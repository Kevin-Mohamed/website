The clinical features are highly variable and can also include vascular defects, congenital cardiac malformations, and other abnormalities. Although autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance is most often observed, autosomal recessive inheritance has been reported (Verdyck et al., 2006). <br> Sybert (1985) and Frieden (1986) provided reviews. <br>

See also liver mitochondrial ALDH2 (100650), variation in which has been implicated in different responses to alcohol ingestion. <br> ALDH1 is associated with a low Km for NAD, a high Km for acetaldehyde, and is strongly inactivated by disulfiram.

In the electric organ the subunits show conspicuous sequence homology. The transmembrane topology of the subunits and the location of functionally important regions, such as the acetylcholine-binding site and the transmembrane segments involved in the ionic channel, have been proposed. <br>

100725=><br> Acetylcholine receptors at mature mammalian neuromuscular junctions are pentameric protein complexes composed of 4 subunits in the ratio of 2 alpha subunits (100690) to 1 beta (100710), 1 epsilon, and 1 delta subunit (100720). Most, if not all, embryonic acetylcholine receptors contain a different subunit, gamma (CHRNG; 100730), in place of the epsilon subunit. It is likely that this change in subunit composition, which occurs during the first 2 weeks after birth, accounts for the switch in properties of acetylcholine-activated channels from low-conductance, long open time to high-conductance, brief open time that occurs over approximately the same time course. In neonatal mouse and rat myotubes, epsilon-subunit mRNA is present at low levels, whereas gamma-subunit mRNA is present at relatively high levels. During the first 2 weeks after birth, the amount of epsilon-subunit mRNA rises 10-fold and gamma-subunit mRNA falls to undetectable levels. The increase in epsilon-subunit mRNA appears to be confined to the developing motor endplate. The switch to the epsilon subunit is mediated by ARIA (acetylcholine receptor-inducing activity; 142445). <br>
100730=><br> For background information on the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), see CHRNA1 (100690). Two forms of AChR are found in mammalian skeletal muscle cells. The mature form is predominant in innervated adult muscle and the embryonic form is present in fetal and denervated muscle. Embryonic and mature AChR differ by the replacement of the gamma subunit in the pentameric glycoprotein complex by its isoform, the epsilon subunit (100725), which is specific to the mature AChR subtype. This switch is mediated by ARIA (acetylcholine receptor-inducing activity; 142445). <br>

Type 2 consists of cloverleaf skull with Pfeiffer hands and feet, together with ankylosis of the elbows. Type 3 is similar to type 2 but without cloverleaf skull. Ocular proptosis is severe, and the anterior cranial base is markedly short. Various visceral malformations have been found in association with type 3. Early demise is characteristic of types 2 and 3. Cohen and Barone (1994) further tabulated the findings in the 3 types of Pfeiffer syndrome. <br>

Growth hormone (GH; 139250)-secreting tumors, which clinically result in acromegaly, comprise about 20% of all pituitary tumors and are the second most common hormone-secreting pituitary tumor after prolactin (176760)-secreting tumors (600634), which account for 40 to 45% of pituitary tumors. ACTH-secreting tumors, resulting in Cushing disease (219090), and thyrotropin (TSHB; 188540)-secreting tumors are much less common. Nonsecreting pituitary tumors, which account for about 33%, can cause symptoms due to local compressive effects of tumor growth (Vierimaa et al., 2006; Georgitsi et al., 2007; Horvath and Stratakis, 2008). <br> Acromegaly is characterized by coarse facial features, protruding jaw, and enlarged extremities (Vierimaa et al., 2006). Familial isolated somatotropinoma (FIS) is defined as the occurrence of at least 2 cases of acromegaly or gigantism in a family that does not exhibit features of other endocrine syndromes. FIS patients tend to have onset about 4 to 10 years earlier than patients with sporadic disease (Gadelha et al., 1999; Horvath and Stratakis, 2008). <br> Familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA) and pituitary adenoma predisposition (PAP) are terms referring to families in which 2 or more individuals develop pituitary tumors. Within a family, tumor types can be heterogeneous, with members of the same family having GH-secreting, prolactin-secreting, ACTH-secreting, or nonsecreting adenomas; in contrast, some families are homogeneous with regard to tumor type. Familial isolated somatotropinoma refers specifically to GH-secreting tumors and is usually associated with an acromegaly phenotype. Thus, FIS is a subset of FIPA or PAP (Toledo et al., 2007). <br> Familial acromegaly can also occur in association with multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN1; 131100), Carney complex (CNC1; 160980), and the McCune-Albright syndrome (174800). <br>

It is stored in the acrosome in its precursor form, proacrosin. The active enzyme functions in the lysis of the zona pellucida, thus facilitating penetration of the sperm through the innermost glycoprotein layers of the ovum. In many species, it is shown that biosynthesis of acrosin is confined to the haploid phase of spermatogenesis (summary by Florke-Gerloff et al., 1983).

102560=><br> Actins are a family of highly conserved cytoskeletal proteins that play fundamental roles in nearly all aspects of eukaryotic cell biology. The ability of a cell to divide, move, endocytose, generate contractile force, and maintain shape is reliant upon functional actin-based structures. Actin isoforms are grouped according to expression patterns: muscle actins predominate in striated and smooth muscle (e.g., ACTA1, 102610, and ACTA2, 102620, respectively), whereas the 2 cytoplasmic nonmuscle actins, gamma-actin (ACTG1) and beta-actin (ACTB; 102630), are found in all cells (Sonnemann et al., 2006). <br>

102575=><br> Alpha-actinin was initially isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle as a factor that induces the gelation of F-actin and promotes the superprecipitation of actomyosin. Subsequently, a number of different isoforms were isolated from both muscle and nonmuscle cells and from a wide variety of organisms. The native molecule is thought to be a homodimer of 97-kD subunits arranged in antiparallel fashion. In myofibrillar cells, alpha-actinin constitutes a major component of Z discs in striated muscle and of the functionally analogous dense bodies and dense plaques in smooth muscle. In nonmuscle cells, it is distributed along microfilament bundles and is thought to mediate their attachment to the membrane at adherens-type junctions (Youssoufian et al., 1990). <br>
102576=><br> Although activins were discovered by virtue of their capacity to stimulate the production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH; 136530) by the pituitary gland and inhibins were initially characterized as FSH inhibitors, activins and inhibins are dimeric proteins that share a common subunit. There are 3 activins (A, B, and A-B), comprising different combinations of 2 closely related beta subunits (beta-A/beta-A; beta-B/beta-B; and beta-A/beta-B, respectively) and 2 inhibins (A and B), consisting of 1 beta-subunit and an inhibin-specific alpha subunit (alpha/beta-A and alpha/beta-B). Activins impinge on a much broader spectrum of cells than do inhibins; however, in those systems in which both proteins are functional, they have opposing biologic effects. Activins are members of a family of polypeptide growth factors that includes also the transforming growth factors-beta (190180, 190220, 190230), mullerian duct-inhibiting substance, and several bone morphogenetic proteins. <br>

Unlike more specialized subnuclear structures, PML-NBs are involved in diverse cellular functions, including sequestration and release of proteins, mediation of posttranslational modifications, and promotion of nuclear events in response to various cellular stresses. The PML gene is involved in the t(15;17) translocation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; 612376), which generates the oncogenic fusion protein PML-retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARA; 180240). PML-NBs are disrupted in APL and are thus implicated in APL pathogenesis (Bernardi and Pandolfi, 2007; Salomoni et al., 2008). <br>

The ADH subunit proteins belonging to class I, based on sequence and structural similarities, are closely linked within an 80-kb region on chromosome 4q22 and account for most of the ethanol-oxidizing capacity in the liver (Osier et al., 2002, Edenberg, 2007). <br> There are at least 5 'classes' of ADH isozymes, classified based on sequence and structural similarities, as well as preferred substrates and biochemical features (Osier et al., 2002). See ADH4 (103740), which belongs to class II; ADH5 (103710), which belongs to class III; ADH6 (103735), which belongs to class V; and ADH7 (600086), which belongs to class IV. Although the greatest similarity seen is among the class I genes, all ADH enzymes are very similar in amino acid sequence and structure (Edenberg, 2000). <br>
103710=><br> There are at least 7 alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) genes that catalyze the conversion of alcohols to aldehydes. Seven genes exist in a cluster on chromosome 4q (see ADH1A, 103700). ADH class III (ADH5; EC 1.1.1.1) is a zinc-containing dimeric enzyme responsible for the oxidation of long-chain alcohols and omega-hydroxy fatty acids. Unlike ADH classes I and II, ADH class III does not metabolize ethanol (Goldman et al., 1989). ADH5 is the same as formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FDH; EC 1.2.1.1), a widely occurring enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of S-hydroxymethylglutathione, formed from formaldehyde and glutathione, into S-formylglutathione in the presence of NAD (Koivusalo et al., 1989). <br>
103720=><br> The ADH1B gene encodes the beta subunit of class I alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) (EC 1.1.1.1), an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step for ethanol metabolism: the oxidation of alcohol to acetaldehyde. Class 1 ADH is a homo- or heterodimeric molecule, formed by the association of 3 types of class I ADH subunits, alpha (ADH1A; 103700), beta, and gamma (ADH1C; 103730) (Edenberg, 2007). <br> For a general discussion of ADH, including evolution of the class I ADH genes, see 103700. <br>
103730=><br> The ADH1C gene encodes the gamma subunit of class I alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) (EC 1.1.1.1), an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step for ethanol metabolism: the oxidation of alcohol to acetaldehyde. Class 1 ADH is a homo- or heterodimeric molecule, formed by the association of 3 types of class I ADH subunits, alpha (ADH1A; 103700), beta (ADH1B; 103720), and gamma (Edenberg, 2007). <br> For a general discussion of ADH, including evolution of the class I ADH genes, see 103700. <br>

103850=><br> Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13) is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The enzyme is a tetramer of identical 40-kD subunits. Vertebrates have 3 aldolase isozymes, aldolases A, B (ALDOB; 612724), and C (ALDOC; 103870), which are distinguished by their electrophoretic and catalytic properties. The sequence of the aldolases around the active-site lysine is highly conserved in evolution. Mammalian tissues express aldolase isozymes in a well-characterized pattern. Developing embryo produces aldolase A, which continues to be expressed in many adult tissues, sometimes at much higher levels than in embryo. In adult muscle, aldolase A can be as much as 5% of total cellular protein. In adult liver, kidney, and intestine, aldolase A expression is repressed and aldolase B is produced. In brain and other nervous tissue, aldolase A and C are expressed about equally. In transformed liver cells, aldolase A replaces aldolase B (Rottmann et al., 1984). <br>

Aldose reductase (EC 1.1.1.21) is a member of the monomeric, NADPH-dependent aldo-keto reductase family and participates in glucose metabolism and osmoregulation. It is believed to play a protective role against toxic aldehydes derived from lipid peroxidation and steroidogenesis that could affect cell growth/differentiation when accumulated (Lefrancois-Martinez et al., 2004). It is the first enzyme of the polyol pathway of sugar metabolism, is most abundantly expressed in adrenal gland, and has been implicated in diabetic complications (Shah et al., 1997). <br>

103950=><br> A2M is a 718-kD homotetrameric glycoprotein of plasma and extracellular spaces that was first recognized as a broad spectrum protease inhibitor. A2M is activated by proteases with which it interacts, and this proteolytic activation causes a conformational change that traps the protease within the A2M homotetramer. In addition, A2M contains several independent domains that function as carriers of specific growth factors and/or binding sites for receptors. Activation of A2M by proteases alters the interaction of A2M with these ligands and induces cell signaling (summary by Mantuano et al., 2008). <br>

104150=><br> Alpha-fetoprotein is a major plasma protein in the fetus, where it is produced by the yolk sac and liver (Ingram et al., 1981). In the adult its concentration is very low except when a tumor such as hepatoma or teratoma is present. The similarity in physical properties of AFP and albumin (ALB; 103600) and the fact that their presence is inversely related suggested that AFP is the fetal counterpart of serum albumin. The alpha-fetoprotein and albumin genes are syntenic; this may represent an ontogenically significant arrangement with switch from AFP to albumin, comparable to the hemoglobin F to hemoglobin A switch (see 141800). Mammalian AFP and serum albumin genes are thought to have arisen through duplication of an ancestral gene 300 to 500 million years ago. <br> The AFP gene is a member of a multigenic family that comprises the related genes encoding ALB, alpha-albumin, or afamin (AFM; 104145), and vitamin D-binding protein, otherwise known as group-specific component (GC; 139200) (Gabant et al., 2002). <br>

Enzyme levels are developmentally regulated and differentiation dependent. The enzyme is present in most mammals but cannot be detected in man, apes, or Old World monkeys. The carbohydrate structure produced by the enzyme is immunogenic in man, and most normal, healthy individuals have a significant titer of a natural antibody against the enzyme. Aberrant expression of the enzyme in man has been implicated in autoimmune disorders and in the occurrence of certain germ cell tumors. <br>

104300=><br> Alzheimer disease is the most common form of progressive dementia in the elderly. It is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the neuropathologic findings of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and extracellular amyloid plaques that accumulate in vulnerable brain regions (Sennvik et al., 2000). <br> Alzheimer disease is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. See also AD2 (104310), associated with the APOE*4 allele (107741) on chromosome 19; AD3 (607822), caused by mutation in the presenilin-1 gene (PSEN1; 104311) on 14q; and AD4 (606889), caused by mutation in the PSEN2 gene (600759) on 1q31. <br> There is evidence for additional AD loci on other chromosomes; see AD5 (602096) on 12p11, AD6 (605526) on 10q24, AD7 (606187) on 10p13, AD8 (607116) on 20p, AD9 (608907) on 19p13, AD10 (609636) on 7q36, AD11 (609790) on 9q22, AD12 (611073) on 8p12-q22, AD13 (611152) on 1q21, AD14 (611154) on 1q25, AD15 (611155) on 3q22-q24, and AD16 (300756) on Xq21.3. <br> Evidence also suggests that mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms may be risk factors in Alzheimer disease (502500). <br> Finally, there have been associations between AD and various polymorphisms in other genes, including alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M; 103950.0005), low density lipoprotein-related protein-1 (LRP1; 107770), the transferrin gene (TF; 190000), the hemochromatosis gene (HFE; 613609), the NOS3 gene (163729), the vascular endothelial growth factor gene (VEGF; 192240), the ABCA2 gene (600047), and the TNF gene (191160) (see MOLECULAR GENETICS). <br> Terry and Davies (1980) pointed out that the 'presenile' form, with onset before age 65, is identical to the most common form of late-onset or 'senile' dementia, and suggested the term 'senile dementia of the Alzheimer type' (SDAT). <br> Haines (1991) reviewed the genetics of AD.

105210=><br> Hereditary amyloidoses are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of autosomal dominantly inherited diseases characterized by the deposit of unsoluble protein fibrils in the extracellular matrix (summary by Hund et al., 2001). Patients with transthyretin amyloidosis typically present with polyneuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, autonomic insufficiency, cardiomyopathy, and gastrointestinal features, occasionally accompanied by vitreous opacities and renal insufficiency. In later stages of the disease severe diarrhea with malabsorption, cachexia, incapacitating neuropathy, severe cardiac disturbances, and marked orthostatic hypotension dominate the clinical picture. Death usually occurs 5 to 15 years after onset of symptoms. <br> Before the emergence of molecular genetics, hereditary amyloidoses were classified into 4 subtypes according to symptom constellation and ethnic origin (summary by Hund et al., 2001). The course of disease beginning with sensorimotor polyneuropathy that starts in early adulthood symmetrically at the legs and progresses rather rapidly to incapacitate the patient within a few years has been labeled familial amyloid polyneuropathy type I (FAP I), also known as Portuguese, Portuguese-Swedish-Japanese, or Andrade type. FAP I can be considered the prototype of the manifestation of hereditary TTR amyloidosis. The overwhelming majority of cases of FAP I result from a val30-to-met (V30M; 176300.0001) substitution. A course of disease with neuropathy beginning at the hands and frequent carpal tunnel operations has been designated FAP II, also known as the Indiana/Swiss (176300.0006) or Maryland/German (176300.0003) type. Vitreous opacities occur early in the disease course, whereas impotence and renal insufficiency are rare. Amyloidosis due to mutations in the APOA1 gene (107650) has been referred to as FAP III or Iowa type (see 105200 and 107680.0010). The Finnish type of amyloidosis (105120) has been referred to as FAP IV and is caused by mutations in gelsolin (137350). <br> Systems based on clinical phenotypes have historically been used to classify the amyloidoses, but emphasis on the characterization of the amyloid fibril protein has proved more useful (Saraiva, 2002). In addition to hereditary amyloidosis, 2 other major forms of systemic amyloidosis exist. Immunoglobulin (AL) amyloidosis, formerly known as primary amyloidosis, is caused by the accumulation of monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) light chains as amyloid fibrils. Reactive (AA) amyloidosis, formerly known as secondary amyloidosis, is associated with chronic inflammatory diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, 180300; familial Mediterranean fever, 249100), and fibrils are derived from the circulating acute-phase reactant serum amyloid A protein (see 104750). <br> Ando et al.

Endogenous ANG is required for cell proliferation induced by other angiogenic proteins such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 192240).

No male-to-male transmission has been described, but father-to-daughter transmissions are known. It has been suggested that the pattern of skin involvement may be due to cutaneous somatic mosaicism (Chen et al., 2006; Blinkenberg et al., 2007). <br> An X-linked dominant form of angioma serpiginosum (300652) has been mapped.

106150=><br> Angiotensin is formed from a precursor, angiotensinogen, which is produced by the liver and found in the alpha-globulin fraction of plasma. The lowering of blood pressure is a stimulus to secretion of renin (179820) by the kidney into the blood. Renin cleaves from angiotensinogen a terminal decapeptide, angiotensin I. This is further altered by the enzymatic removal of a dipeptide to form angiotensin II. <br>

106165=><br> Angiotensin II (see 106150) is an important effector controlling blood pressure and volume in the cardiovascular system. Its importance is reflected by the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Angiotensin II interacts with 2 pharmacologically distinct subtypes of cell surface receptors, types 1 and 2 (AGTR2; 300034). Type 1 receptors seem to mediate the major cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II (Murphy et al., 1991). <br>
106180=><br> Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1), or kininase II, is a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase that plays an important role in blood pressure regulation and electrolyte balance by hydrolyzing angiotensin I into angiotensin II, a potent vasopressor, and aldosterone-stimulating peptide.

These phenotypes are difficult to differentiate because they may occur simultaneously or sequentially in the same patient. Studies have suggested that a predominant shared component, including HLA-B27, predisposes to all phenotypic subsets, and that these subsets should be considered as various phenotypic expressions of the same disease (Said-Nahal et al., 2000, Said-Nahal et al., 2001). <br> Braun and Sieper (2007) provided a detailed review of ankylosing spondylitis, including clinical features, pathogenesis, and management. <br>

Although tooth agenesis is associated with numerous syndromes, several case reports describe nonsyndromic forms that are either sporadic or familial in nature, as reviewed by Gorlin et al. (1990). The incidence of familial tooth agenesis varies with each class of teeth. Most commonly affected are third molars (wisdom teeth), followed by either upper lateral incisors or lower second premolars; agenesis involving first and second molars is very rare. Also see 114600 and 302400. <br> Selective tooth agenesis without associated systemic disorders has sometimes been divided into 2 types: oligodontia, defined as agenesis of 6 or more permanent teeth, and hypodontia, defined as agenesis of less than 6 teeth. The number in both cases does not include absence of third molars (wisdom teeth). Faulty use of the terms, however, have confounded their use. The term 'partial anodontia' is obsolete (Salinas, 1978). <br>

In man, the normal serum level is about one-tenth that of alpha-1-antitrypsin (PI; 107400), with which it shares nucleic acid and protein sequence homology (Chandra et al., 1983). Both are major acute phase reactants; their concentrations in plasma increase in response to trauma, surgery, and infection.

It belongs to the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) superfamily of inhibitors and structurally related proteins, which contain reactive centers that have evolved to attract and entrap certain proteinases. Inherited antithrombin III deficiency (613118) is a risk factor for the early development of venous thromboembolism (summary by Lane et al., 1994). <br> Antithrombin III regulates clot formation both by inhibiting thrombin activity directly and by interfering with earlier stages of the clotting cascade. Rosenberg and Bauer (1987) gave an excellent review of defects in the anticoagulant systems. They wrote as follows: 'The coagulation cascade can be pictured as a series of reactions in which a zymogen, a cofactor, and a converting enzyme interact to form a multimolecular complex on a natural surface. In each case, the 4 reactants must be present if the conversion of a zymogen to the corresponding serine protease is to take place at any significant rate. The principal natural anticoagulant systems that are able to exert damping effects on the various steps of the cascade are the heparin-antithrombin and protein C-thrombomodulin mechanisms that regulate the serine proteases and the cofactors or activated cofactors, respectively.' <br>

The biologic effects of human interferons, including increment of histocompatibility antigens, are mediated through species-specific receptors.

107741=><br> - Early Delineation <br> Utermann et al. (1979) described 2 phenotypes, apoE(IV+) and apoE(IV-), differentiated by analytical isoelectric focusing. They concluded that this polymorphism of apolipoprotein E in human serum is determined by 2 autosomal codominant alleles, apoE(n) and apoE(d). Homozygosity for the latter results in primary dysbetalipoproteinemia but only some persons develop gross hyperlipidemia (hyperlipoproteinemia type III). Vertical transmission is pseudodominance due to high frequency of the apoE(d) gene (Utermann et al., 1979). Dysbetalipoproteinemia is already expressed in childhood. They concluded that primary dysbetalipoproteinemia is a frequent monogenic variant of lipoprotein metabolism, but not a disease. Coincidence of the genes for this dyslipoproteinemia with any of the genes for monogenic or polygenic forms of familial hyperlipemia results in hyperlipoproteinemia type III. Further complexities of the genetics of the apolipoprotein E system were discussed by Utermann et al. (1980). Apolipoprotein E (apoE) of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) from different persons shows 1 of 2 complex patterns, termed alpha and beta (Zannis et al., 1981). Three subclasses of each pattern were found and designated alpha-II, alpha-III and alpha-IV and beta-II, beta-III and beta-IV. From family studies, Zannis et al. (1981) concluded that a single locus with 3 common alleles is responsible for these patterns. The alleles were designated epsilon-II, -III, and-IV. The authors further concluded that beta class phenotypes represent homozygosity for one of the epsilon alleles, e.g., beta-II results from homozygosity for the epsilon-II allele. In contrast, the alpha phenotypes are thought to represent compound heterozygosity, i.e., heterozygosity for 2 different epsilon alleles: alpha II from epsilon II and III; alpha III from epsilon III and IV. The frequency of the epsilon II, III, and IV alleles was estimated at 0.11, 0.72, and 0.17, respectively. ApoE subclass beta-IV was found to be associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemia. Rall et al. (1982) published the full amino acid sequence. Mature apoE is a 299-amino acid polypeptide. <br> - Molecular Basis of Polymorphism <br> The 3 major isoforms of human apolipoprotein E (apoE2, -E3, and -E4), as identified by isoelectric focusing, are coded for by 3 alleles (epsilon 2, 3, and 4). The E2 (107741.0001), E3 (107741.0015), and E4 (107741.0016) isoforms differ in amino acid sequence at 2 sites, residue 112 (called site A) and residue 158 (called site B). At sites A/B, apoE2, -E3, and -E4 contain cysteine/cysteine, cysteine/arginine, and arginine/arginine, respectively (Weisgraber et al., 1981; Rall et al., 1982). The 3 forms have 0, 1+, and 2+ charges to account for electrophoretic differences (Margolis, 1982). (The nomenclature of the apolipoprotein E isoforms, defined by isoelectric focusing, has gone through an evolution.) E3 is the most frequent ('wildtype') isoform. As reviewed by Smit et al. (1990), E4 differs from E3 by a cys-to-arg change at position 112 and is designated E4(cys112-to-arg). Four different mutations giving a band at the E2 position with isoelectric focusing have been described: E2(arg158-to-cys), E2(lys146-to-gln), E2(arg145-to-cys) and E2-Christchurch(arg136-to-ser). E2(arg158-to-cys) is the most common of the 4. <br> In a comprehensive review of apoE variants, de Knijff et al. (1994) found that 30 variants had been characterized, including the most common variant, apoE3. To that time, 14 apoE variants had been found to be associated with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, characterized by elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels and an increased risk for atherosclerosis. <br> Data on gene frequencies of apoE allelic variants were tabulated by Roychoudhury and Nei (1988). Gerdes et al. (1992) and Gerdes et al. (1996) reported the frequency of apoE polymorphisms in the Danish population and in Greenland Inuit, respectively, in relation to the findings in 45 other study populations around the world. <br> - Role of APOE in Abnormalities of Blood Lipids and in Cardiovascular Disease <br> In normal individuals, chylomicron remnants and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) remnants are rapidly removed from the circulation by receptor-mediated endocytosis in the liver. In familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, or type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP III), increased plasma cholesterol and triglycerides are the consequence of impaired clearance of chylomicron and VLDL remnants because of a defect in apolipoprotein E. Accumulation of the remnants can result in xanthomatosis and premature coronary and/or peripheral vascular disease. Hyperlipoproteinemia III can be either due to primary heritable defects in apolipoprotein metabolism or secondary to other conditions such as hypothyroidism, systemic lupus erythematosus, or diabetic acidosis. Most patients with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (HLP III) are homozygous for the E2 isoform (Breslow et al., 1982). Only rarely does the disorder occur with the heterozygous phenotypes E3E2 or E4E2. The E2 isoform shows defective binding of remnants to hepatic lipoprotein receptors (Schneider et al., 1981; Rall et al., 1982) and delayed clearance from plasma (Gregg et al., 1981). Additional genetic and/or environmental factors must be required for development of the disorder, however, because only 1-4% of E2E2 homozygotes develop familial dysbetalipoproteinemia. Since the defect in this disorder involves the exogenous cholesterol transport system, the degree of hypercholesterolemia is sensitive to the level of cholesterol in the diet (Brown et al., 1981). Even on a normal diet, the patient may show increased plasma cholesterol and the presence of an abnormal lipoprotein called beta-VLDL. VLDL in general is markedly increased while LDL is reduced. Carbohydrate induces or exacerbates the hyperlipidemia, resulting in marked variability in plasma levels and ready therapy through dietary means. Often tuberous and planar and sometimes tendon xanthomas occur as well as precocious atherosclerosis and abnormal glucose tolerance. Tuberous and tuberoeruptive xanthomas are particularly characteristic. Hazzard (1978) demonstrated the eliciting effects of electric shock in a man revived from accidental electrocution and later showing striking xanthomas of the palms. Development of the phenotype is age dependent, being rarely evident before the third decade. The nosography of the type III hyperlipoproteinemia phenotype up to 1977 was reviewed by Levy and Morganroth (1977). Subsequent description of specific biochemical alterations in apolipoprotein structure and metabolism has proven this phenotype to be genetically heterogeneous. In the first application of apoprotein immunoassay to this group of disorders, Kushwaha et al. (1977) found that apolipoprotein E (arginine-rich lipoprotein) is high in the VLD lipoproteins of type III. They also found that exogenous estrogen, which stimulates triglyceride production in normal women and those with endogenous hypertriglyceridemia, exerted a paradoxical hypotriglyceridemic effect in this disorder (Kushwaha et al., 1977). The abnormal pattern of apoE by isoelectric focusing (IEF), specifically, the absence of apoE3, is the most characteristic biochemical feature of HLP III. Gregg et al. (1981) showed that apoE isolated from subjects with type III HLP had a decreased fractional catabolic rate in vivo in both type III HLP patients and normal persons. <br> Hazzard et al. (1981) reported on the large O'Donnell kindred, studied because of a proband with type III HLP. They studied specifically the VLDL isoapolipoprotein E distributions. The findings confirmed earlier work indicating that the ratio of E3 to E2 is determined by two apoE3 alleles, designated d and n, which produce 3 phenotypes, apoE3-d, apoE3-nd, and apoE3-n, corresponding to the low, intermediate, and high ratios. <br> Ghiselli et al. (1981) studied a black kindred with type III HLP due to deficiency of apolipoprotein E. No plasma apolipoprotein E could be detected. Other families with type III HLP have had increased amounts of an abnormal apoE. In addition, the patients of Ghiselli et al. (1981) had only mild hypertriglyceridemia, increased LDL cholesterol, and a much higher ratio of VLDL cholesterol to plasma triglyceride than reported in other type III HLP families. The proband was a 60-year-old woman with a 10-year history of tuberoeruptive xanthomas of the elbows and knees, a 3-year history of angina pectoris, and 80% narrowing of the first diagonal coronary artery by arteriography. Her father had xanthomas and died at age 62 of myocardial infarction. Her mother was alive and well at age 86. Three of 7 sibs also had xanthomas; her 2 offspring had no xanthomas. The evidence suggests that apoE is important for the catabolism of chylomicron fragments. The affected persons in the family studied by Ghiselli et al. (1981) had plasma levels of apoE less than 0.05 mg/dl by radioimmunoassay, and no structural variants of apoE were detected by immunoblot of plasma or VLDL separated by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Anchors et al. (1986) reported that the apoE gene was present in the apoE-deficient patient and that there were no major insertions or deletions in the gene by Southern blot analysis. Blood monocyte-macrophages isolated from a patient contained levels of apoE mRNA 1 to 3% of that present in monocyte-macrophages isolated from normal subjects. The mRNA from the patient appeared to be of normal size. Anchors et al. (1986) suggested that the decreased apoE mRNA might be due to a defect in transcription or processing of the primary transcript or to instability of the apoE mRNA. The decreased plasma level of apoE resulted in delayed clearance of remnants of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, hyperlipidemia, and the phenotype of type III HLP. In the kindred with apolipoprotein E deficiency studied by Ghiselli et al. (1981), the defect was shown by Cladaras et al. (1987) to involve an acceptor splice site mutation in intron 3 of the APOE gene (107741.0005). <br> ApoE, a main apoprotein of the chylomicron, binds to a specific receptor on liver cells and peripheral cells. The E2 variant binds less readily. A defect in the receptor for apoE on liver and peripheral cells might also lead to dysbetalipoproteinemia, but such has not been observed. Weisgraber et al. (1982) showed that human E apoprotein of the E2 form, which contains cysteine (rather than arginine) at both of the 2 variable sites, binds poorly with cell surface receptors, whereas E3 and E4 bind well. They postulated that a positively charged residue at variable site B is important for normal binding. To test the hypothesis, they treated E2 apoE with cysteamine to convert cysteine to a positively charged lysine analog. This resulted in a marked increase in the binding activity of the E2 apoE. Although nearly every type III hyperlipoproteinemic person has the E2/E2 phenotype, 95 to 99% of persons with this phenotype do not have type III HLP nor do they have elevated plasma cholesterol levels. Rall et al. (1983) showed that apoE2 of hypo-, normo-, and hypercholesterolemic subjects showed the same severe functional abnormalities. Thus, factors in addition to the defective receptor binding activity of the apoE2 are necessary for manifestation of type III HLP. A variety of factors exacerbate or modulate type III. In women, it most often occurs after the menopause and in such patients is particularly sensitive to estrogen therapy. Hypothyroidism exacerbates type III and thyroid hormone is known to enhance receptor-mediated lipoprotein metabolism. Obesity, diabetes, and age are associated with increased hepatic synthesis of VLDL and/or cholesterol; occurrence of type III in E2/E2 persons with these factors may be explained thereby. Furthermore, the defect in familial combined HLP (144250), which is, it seems, combined with E2/E2 in the production of type III (Utermann et al., 1979; Hazzard et al., 1981), may be hepatic overproduction of cholesterol and VLDL. As pointed out by Brown and Goldstein (1983), familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic defect of the LDL receptor (LDLR; 606945), whereas familial dysbetalipoproteinemia is a genetic defect in a ligand. The puzzle that all apoE2/2 homozygotes do not have extremely high plasma levels of IDL and chylomicron remnants (apoE-containing lipoproteins) may be solved by the observation that the lipoprotein levels in these patients are exquisitely sensitive to factors that reduce hepatic LDL receptors, e.g., age, decreased levels of thyroid hormone and estrogen, and the genetic defect of FH. Presumably, high levels of hepatic LDL receptors can compensate for the genetic binding defect of E2 homozygotes. <br> Gregg et al. (1983) suggested that apoE4 is associated with severe type V hyperlipoproteinemia (144650) in a manner comparable to the association of apoE2 with type III. Vogel et al. (1985) showed that large amounts of apoE can be produced by E. coli transformed with a plasmid containing a human apoE cDNA. The use in studies of structure-function relationships through production of site-specific mutants was noted. Wardell et al. (1989) demonstrated that the defect is a 7-amino acid insertion that represents a tandem repeat of amino acid residues 121-127 resulting in the normal protein having 306 amino acids rather than the normal 299. Schaefer et al. (1986) described a unique American black kindred with premature cardiovascular disease, tuberoeruptive xanthomas, and type III HLP associated with familial apolipoprotein E deficiency. Four homozygotes had marked increases in cholesterol-rich, very low density lipoproteins and intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL). Homozygotes had only trace amounts of plasma apoE, and accumulations of apoB-48 (107730) and apoA-4 (107690) in VLDL, IDL, and low density lipoproteins. Obligate heterozygotes generally had normal plasma lipids and mean plasma apoE concentrations that were 42% of normal. The findings indicated that apoE is essential for the normal catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein constituents. It had been shown that cultured peripheral blood monocytes synthesized low amounts of 2 aberrant forms of apoE mRNA but produced no immunoprecipitable forms of apoE. The expression studies were done comparing the normal and abnormal APOE genes transfected into mouse cells in combination with the mouse metallothionein I promoter. Bersot et al. (1983) studied atypical dysbetalipoproteinemia characterized by severe hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, xanthomatosis, premature vascular disease, the apoE3/3 phenotype (rather than the classic E2/2 phenotype), and a preponderance of beta-VLDL. They showed that the beta-VLDL from these subjects stimulated cholesteryl ester accumulation in mouse peritoneal macrophages. They suggested that the accelerated vascular disease results from this uptake by macrophages which are converted into the foam cells of atherosclerotic lesions. Smit et al. (1987) described 3 out of 41 Dutch dysbetalipoproteinemic patients who were apparent E3/E2 heterozygotes rather than the usual E2/E2 homozygotes. All 3 genetically unrelated patients showed an uncommon E2 allele that contained only 1 cysteine residue. The uncommon allele cosegregated with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia which in these families seemed to behave as a dominant. Smit et al. (1990) showed that these 3 unrelated patients had E2(lys146-to-gln). Eto et al. (1989) presented data from Japan indicating that both the E2 allele and the E4 allele are associated with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease as compared with the E3 allele. Boerwinkle and Utermann (1988) studied the simultaneous effect of apolipoprotein E polymorphism on apolipoprotein E, apolipoprotein B, and cholesterol metabolism. Since both apoB and apoE bind to the LDL receptor and since the different isoforms show different binding affinity, these effects are not unexpected. <br> Subjects with typical dysbetalipoproteinemia are homozygous for an amino acid substitution in apoE at residue 158 (107741.0001). Chappell (1989) studied the binding properties of lipoproteins in 9 subjects with dysbetalipoproteinemia who were either homozygous or heterozygous for substitutions at atypical sites: at residue 142 in 6, at 145 in 2, and at 146 in 1. <br> In 5 of 19 Australian men, aged 30 to 50, who were referred for coronary angioplasty (26%), van Bockxmeer and Mamotte (1992) observed homozygosity for E4. This represented a 16-fold increase compared with controls. Payne et al. (1992), O'Malley and Illingworth (1992), and de Knijff et al. (1992) expressed doubts concerning a relationship between E4 and atherosclerosis. <br> In a case-control study of 338 centenarians compared with adults aged 20 to 70 years of age, Schachter et al. (1994) found that the E4 allele of apoE, which promotes premature atherosclerosis, was significantly less frequent in centenarians than in controls (p = less than 0.001), while the frequency of the E2 allele, associated previously with types III and IV hyperlipidemia, was significantly increased (p = less than 0.01). <br> Feussner et al. (1996) reported a 20-year-old man with a combination of type III hyperlipoproteinemia and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH; 143890). Multiple xanthomas were evident on the elbows, interphalangeal joints and interdigital webs of the hands. Lipid-lowering therapy caused significant decrease of cholesterol and triglycerides as well as regression of the xanthomas. Flat xanthomas of the interdigital webs were also described in 3 out of 4 previously reported patients with combination of these disorders of lipoprotein metabolism. Feussner et al. (1996) stated that these xanthomas may indicate compound heterozygosity (actually double heterozygosity) for type III hyperlipoproteinemia and FH. <br> To study the effect of birth weight on apoE genetic determinants of circulating lipid levels, Garces et al. (2002) evaluated apoE genotypes and plasma lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations in 933 children (491 males and 442 females), aged 6 to 8 years (mean 6.7 years), with known birth weights. A greater effect of the apoE polymorphism on total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), and apoB levels was found in the lower tertile than in the upper tertiles of birth weight in both genders. A decrease in TC, LDL-C and apoB associated with the E2 allele became more marked the lower the birth weight and could be explained by the significant positive interaction between birth weight and the E2 allele shown by linear regression analysis. Garces et al. (2002) suggested that the interaction of apoE genotype and birth weight may be an important determinant for atherosclerosis. <br> In 802 patients undergoing transthoracic echocardiography, Novaro et al. (2003) evaluated the association between apoE alleles and calcific valvular lesions of the heart. The authors found that the genotype distribution of patients with aortic stenosis (AS) differed significantly from those without AS (p = 0.03), with increasing prevalences of the apoE4 allele (27% in those without vs 40% in those with AS, p = 0.01). In multivariate analyses adjusting for age, gender, LDL cholesterol levels, and coronary artery disease, increasing age and the apoE4 allele were significant predictors of AS (OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.01-3.71, p = 0.046). There was no difference in genotype distribution or prevalence of apoE4 between those with or without mitral annular calcification, however, and the apoE4 allele was not predictive of mitral annular calcification. <br> Witsch-Baumgartner et al. (2004) determined common APOE and DHCR7 (602858) genotypes in 137 unrelated patients with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (270400) and 108 of their parents (59 mothers and 49 fathers). There was a significant correlation between patients' clinical severity scores and maternal APOE genotypes (p = 0.028) but not between severity scores and patients' or paternal APOE genotypes. Presence of the maternal APOE2 allele was associated with a more severe phenotype, and the association persisted after stratification for DHCR7 genotype. Witsch-Baumgartner et al. (2004) suggested that the efficiency of cholesterol transport from the mother to the embryo is affected by maternal APOE genotype, and that APOE plays a role in modulation of embryonic development and malformations. <br> Frikke-Schmidt et al. (2007) presented evidence that combinations of SNPs in APOE and LPL (609708) identify subgroups of individuals at substantially increased risk of ischemic heart disease beyond that associated with smoking, diabetes, and hypertension. <br> Kathiresan et al. (2008) studied SNPs in 9 genes in 5,414 subjects from the cardiovascular cohort of the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study. All 9 SNPs, including dbSNP rs4420638 of APOE, had previously been associated with elevated LDL or lower HDL. Kathiresan et al. (2008) replicated the associations with each SNP and created a genotype score on the basis of the number of unfavorable alleles. With increasing genotype scores, the level of LDL cholesterol increased, whereas the level of HDL cholesterol decreased. At 10-year follow-up, the genotype score was found to be an independent risk factor for incident cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or death from coronary heart disease); the score did not improve risk discrimination but modestly improved clinical risk reclassification for individual subjects beyond standard clinical factors. <br> Among 1,383 Scottish adult patients with diabetes taking statin medication to reduce serum LDL cholesterol levels, Donnelly et al. (2008) found an association of APOE genotype with both baseline and treatment responses. E2 homozygotes achieved significantly lower LDL levels compared to E4 homozygotes (mean 0.6 versus 1.7 mmol/L; p = 2.96 x 10(-12)). All E2 homozygotes reached the target serum LDL level, compared to 32% of E4 homozygotes who did not (p = 5.3 x 10(-5)). The findings indicated that APOE genotype may be an important marker for clinical responses to statin drugs. <br> - Role in Immunologic Response <br> Van den Elzen et al. (2005) defined the pathways mediating markedly efficient exogenous lipid antigen delivery by apolipoproteins to achieve T-cell activation. Apolipoprotein E binds lipid antigens and delivers them by receptor-mediated uptake into endosomal compartments containing CD1 (e.g., 188370) in antigen-presenting cells. Apolipoprotein E mediates the presentation of serum-borne lipid antigens and can be secreted by antigen-presenting cells as a mechanism to survey the local environment to capture antigens or to transfer microbial lipids from infected cells to bystander antigen-presenting cells. Thus, van den Elzen et al. (2005) concluded that the immune system has co-opted a component of lipid metabolism to develop immunologic responses to lipid antigens. <br> - Role in Alzheimer Disease <br> Saunders et al. (1993) reported an increased frequency of the E4 allele in a small prospective series of possible-probable AD patients presenting to the memory disorders clinic at Duke University, in comparison with spouse controls. Corder et al. (1993) found that the APOE*E4 allele is associated with the late-onset familial and sporadic forms of Alzheimer disease. In 42 families with the late-onset form of Alzheimer disease (AD2; 104310), the gene had been mapped to the same region of chromosome 19 as the APOE gene. Corder et al. (1993) found that the risk for AD increased from 20 to 90% and mean age of onset decreased from 84 to 68 years with increasing number of APOE*E4 alleles. Homozygosity for APOE*E4 was virtually sufficient to cause AD by age 80. <br> Lannfelt et al. (1995) compared allelic frequency of apolipoprotein E4 in 13 dizygotic twin pairs discordant for Alzheimer disease and found the expected increased frequency of the epsilon-4 allele in Alzheimer compared to healthy cotwins. In a well-known American kindred with late-onset Alzheimer disease, descended from a couple who immigrated to the United States from France in the 18th century, Borgaonkar et al. (1993) found evidence confirming a dosage effect of the E4 allele of 6 affected individuals; 4 E4/E4 homozygotes had onset in their 60s, whereas 2 E4/E3 heterozygotes had onset at ages 77 and 78, respectively. Apolipoprotein E is found in senile plaques, congophilic angiopathy, and neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer disease. Strittmatter et al. (1993) compared the binding of synthetic amyloid beta peptide to purified APOE4 and APOE3, the most common isoforms. Both isoforms in oxidized form bound the amyloid beta peptide; however, binding to APOE4 was observed in minutes, whereas binding to APOE3 required hours. Strittmatter et al. (1993) concluded that binding of amyloid beta peptide by oxidized apoE may determine their sequestration and that isoform-specific differences in apoE binding or oxidation may be involved in the pathogenesis of the lesions of Alzheimer disease. <br> In a study of 91 patients with sporadic Alzheimer disease and 74 controls, Poirier et al. (1993) found a significant association between E4 and sporadic AD. The association was more pronounced in women. Scott (1993) pointed to the need for caution in the application of knowledge gained through screening of E4 in relation to this very common disorder. <br> Talbot et al. (1994) presented data suggesting that the E2 allele may confer protection against Alzheimer disease and that its effect is not simply the absence of an E4 allele. Corder et al. (1994) presented data demonstrating a protective effect of the E2 allele, in addition to the dosage effect of the E4 allele in sporadic AD. Although a substantial proportion (65%) of AD is attributable to the presence of E4 alleles, risk of AD is lowest in subjects with the E2/E3 genotype, with an additional 23% of AD attributable to the absence of an E2 allele. The opposite actions of the E2 and E4 alleles were interpreted by Corder et al. (1994) to provide further support for the direct involvement of APOE in the pathogenesis of AD. <br> Sanan et al. (1994) demonstrated that the E4 isoform binds to the beta amyloid (A-beta) peptide more rapidly than the E3 isoform. Soluble SDS-stable complexes of E3 or E4, formed by coincubation with the A-beta peptide, precipitated after several days of incubation at 37 degrees C, with E4 complexes precipitating more rapidly than E3 complexes. <br> Hyman et al. (1996) demonstrated homozygosity for the E4 genotype in an 86-year-old man with no history of neurologic disease and whose autopsy did not reveal any neurofibrillary tangles and only rare mature senile plaques. This suggested to the authors that inheritance of apoE4 does not necessarily result in the development of dementia or Alzheimer disease. <br> Myers et al. (1996) examined the association of apolipoprotein E4 with Alzheimer disease and other dementias in 1,030 elderly individuals in the Framingham Study cohort. They found an increased risk for Alzheimer disease as well as other dementias in patients who were homozygous or heterozygous for E4. However they pointed out that most apoE4 carriers do not develop dementia and about one-half of Alzheimer disease is not associated with apoE4. <br> Kawamata et al. (1994) examined the E4 frequency in 40 patients with late-onset sporadic Alzheimer disease, 13 patients with early-onset sporadic Alzheimer disease, 19 patients with vascular dementia, and 49 nondemented control subjects. In the late-onset sporadic Alzheimer group, the allele frequency was 0.25, considerably higher than the frequency in controls, 0.09. In contrast, there was no increased frequency in early-onset sporadic Alzheimer disease or in patients with vascular dementia. Olichney et al. (1996) found that the apolipoprotein E4 allele is strongly associated with increased neuritic plaques but not neocortical or fibrillary tangles in both Alzheimer disease and the Lewy body variant. <br> Kawamata et al. (1994) speculated that the lower magnitude of the raised frequency of E4 in the Japanese group compared to that of North American families may be due to a lower E4 frequency in the normal Japanese population and lower morbidity from Alzheimer disease in Japan. Nalbantoglu et al. (1994) performed apolipoprotein analysis on 113 postmortem cases of sporadic Alzheimer disease and 77 control brains in Montreal. In this population, the odds ratio associating E4 with Alzheimer disease was 15.5 and the population attributable risk was 0.53. Yoshizawa et al. (1994) examined the apolipoprotein genotypes in 83 Japanese patients with Alzheimer disease. They found a significant increase in apoE4 frequency in late-onset sporadic Alzheimer disease and a mild increase of apoE4 frequency in late- and early-onset familial Alzheimer disease. In contrast, they found no association between apoE4 and early-onset sporadic Alzheimer disease. <br> Lucotte et al. (1994) examined the apoE4 frequency in 132 French patients with onset of Alzheimer disease after 60 years of age. They found that homozygosity for the E4 allele was associated with a younger age of disease occurrence than was heterozygosity or absence of the E4 allele. Osuntokun et al. (1995) found no association between E4 and Alzheimer disease in elderly Nigerians, in contrast to the strong association reported in their previous study of African Americans in Indianapolis. Levy-Lahad et al. (1995) found that the epsilon 4 allele did not affect the age of onset in either Alzheimer disease type 4 present in Volga Germans (600753) or Alzheimer disease type 3 (607822). This suggested to them that some forms of early onset familial Alzheimer disease are not influenced by the apolipoprotein E system. <br> Bennett et al. (1995) examined the APOE genotype in family history-positive and family history-negative cases of Alzheimer disease and found a distortion of the APOE allele frequencies similar to those with previous studies. However, they also examined the allele distribution of at-risk sibs and found an excess of the E4 allele which did not differ from that of affected sibs. In these families, they found no evidence for linkage between the APOE4 locus and Alzheimer disease. They concluded that the APOE locus is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause Alzheimer disease and speculated that it may modify the preclinical progression, and therefore the age of onset, in people otherwise predisposed to develop Alzheimer disease. <br> Head injury is an epidemiologic risk factor for Alzheimer disease and deposition of A-beta occurs in approximately one-third of individuals dying after severe head injury. Nicoll et al. (1995) found that the frequency of APOE4 in individuals with A-beta deposition following head injury (0.52) was higher than in most studies of Alzheimer disease, while in those head-injured individuals without A-beta deposition, the APOE4 frequency (0.16) was similar to controls without Alzheimer disease (P = less than 0.00001). Thus, environmental and genetic risk factors for Alzheimer disease may act additively. <br> In a review of apolipoprotein E and Alzheimer disease, Strittmatter and Roses (1995) pointed out that isoform-specific differences have been identified in the binding of apoE to the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT; 157140), which forms the paired helical filament and neurofibrillary tangles, and to amyloid beta peptide (APP; 104760), a major component of the neuritic plaque. Identification of apoE in the cytoplasm of human neurons and isoform-specific binding of apoE to the microtubule-associated protein tau and MAP-2 (157130) make it possible that apoE may affect microtubule function in the Alzheimer brain. Blennow et al. (1994) demonstrated a significant reduction of CSF apolipoprotein E in Alzheimer disease compared to that of controls. They suggested that the increased reutilization of apolipoprotein E lipid complexes in the brain in Alzheimer disease may explain the low CSF concentration. <br> The observation that the APOE4 allele is neither necessary nor sufficient for the expression of AD emphasizes the significance of other environmental or genetic factors that, either in conjunction with APOE4 or alone, increase the risk of AD. Kamboh et al. (1995) noted that among the candidate genes that might affect the risk for Alzheimer disease is alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (AACT; 107280) because, like APOE protein, AACT binds to beta-amyloid peptide with high affinity in the filamentous deposits found in the AD brain. Additionally, it serves as a strong stimulatory factor in the polymerization of beta-amyloid peptide into amyloid filaments. Kamboh et al. (1995) demonstrated that a common polymorphism in the signal peptide of AACT (107280.0005) confers a significant risk for AD and that the APOE4 gene dosage effect associated with AD risk is significantly modified by the AACT polymorphism. They identified the combination of the AACT 'AA' genotype with the APOE4/4 genotype as a potential susceptibility marker for AD, as its frequency was 1/17 in the AD group compared to 1/313 in the general population controls. It is noteworthy that one form of Alzheimer disease (designated Alzheimer type 3, 607822), like AACT, maps to 14q; however, AACT and AD3 are located at somewhat different sites on 14q. <br> Tang et al. (1996) compared relative risks by APOE genotypes in a collection of cases and controls from 3 ethnic groups in a New York community. The relative risk for Alzheimer disease associated with APOE4 homozygosity was increased in all ethnic groups: African American RR = 3.0; Caucasian RR = 7.3; and Hispanic RR = 2.5 (compared with the RR with APOE3 homozygosity). The risk was also increased for APOE4 heterozygous Caucasians and Hispanics, but not for African Americans. The age distribution of the proportion of Caucasian and Hispanics without AD was consistently lower for APOE4 homozygous and APOE4 heterozygous individuals than for those with other APOE genotypes. In African Americans this relationship was observed only in APOE4 homozygotes. Differences in risk among APOE4 heterozygous African Americans suggested to the authors that other genetic or environmental factors may modify the effect of APOE4 in some populations. <br> In a study of 85 Scottish persons with early onset Alzheimer disease, St Clair et al. (1995) found highly significant enrichment for both homozygous and heterozygous APOE epsilon-4 allele carriers in both familial and sporadic cases with a pattern closely resembling that in late-onset AD. <br> As reviewed earlier, the APOE4 allele is associated with sporadic and late-onset familial Alzheimer disease. Gene dose has an effect on risk of developing AD, age of onset, accumulation of senile plaques in the brain, and reduction of choline acetyltransferase (118490) in the hippocampus of AD patients. Poirier et al. (1995) examined the effect of APOE4 allele copy number on pre- and postsynaptic markers of cholinergic activity. APOE4 allele copy number showed an inverse relationship with residual brain CHAT activity and nicotinic receptor binding sites in both the hippocampal formation and the temporal cortex of AD subjects. AD subjects lacking the APOE4 allele showed CHAT activities close to or within the age-matched normal control range. Poirier et al. (1995) then assessed the effect of the APOE4 allele on cholinomimetic drug responsiveness in 40 AD patients who completed a double-blind, 30-week clinical trial of the cholinesterase inhibitor tacrine. Results showed that more than 80% of APOE4-negative AD patients showed marked improvement after 30 weeks, whereas 60% of APOE4 carriers had poor responses. <br> Polvikoski et al. (1995) reported on an autopsy study involving neuropathologic analysis and DNA analysis of frozen blood specimens performed in 92 of 271 persons who were at least 85 years of age, who had been living in Vantaa, Finland, on April 1, 1991, and who had died between that time and the end of 1993. All subjects had been tested for dementia. Apolipoprotein E genotyping was done with a solid-phase minisequencing technique. The percentage of cortex occupied by methenamine silver-stained plaques was used as an estimate of the extent of beta-amyloid protein deposition. They found that the APOE4 allele was significantly associated with Alzheimer disease. Even in elderly subjects without dementia, the apolipoprotein E4 genotype was related to the degree of deposition of beta-amyloid protein in the cerebral cortex. <br> In late-onset familial AD, women have a significantly higher risk of developing the disease than do men. Studying 58 late-onset familial AD kindreds, Payami et al. (1996) detected a significant gender difference for the APOE4 heterozygous genotype. In women, APOE4 heterozygotes had higher risk than those without APOE4; there was no significant difference between APOE4 heterozygotes and APOE4 homozygotes. In men, APOE4 heterozygotes had lower risk than APOE4 homozygotes; there was no significant difference between APOE4 heterozygotes and those without APOE4. A direct comparison of APOE4 heterozygous men and women revealed a significant 2-fold increased risk in women. These results were corroborated in studies of 15 autopsy-confirmed AD kindreds from the National Cell Repository at Indiana University Alzheimer Disease Center. <br> Mahley (1988) provided a review documenting the expanding role of apoE as a cholesterol transport protein in cell biology. The pronounced production and accumulation of apoE in response to peripheral nerve injury and during the regenerative process indicates, for example, that apoE plays a prominent role in the redistribution of cholesterol to the neurites for membrane biosynthesis during axon elongation and to the Schwann cells for myelin formation. Poirier (1994) reviewed the coordinated expression of apoE and its receptor, the apoE/apoB LDL receptor (606945), in the regulation of transport of cholesterol and phospholipids during the early and intermediate phases of reinnervation, both in the peripheral and in the central nervous system. He proposed that the linkage of the E4 allele to Alzheimer disease (104300) may represent dysfunction of the lipid transport system associated with compensatory sprouting and synaptic remodeling central to the Alzheimer disease process. <br> Tomimoto et al. (1995) found only 3 cases with focal accumulation of apolipoprotein E in dystrophic axons and accompanying macrophages in 9 cases of cerebral vascular disease and 4 control subjects. The results suggested to the authors that apolipoprotein E may have a role in recycling cholesterol in other membrane components in the brain, but that this phenomenon is restricted to the periphery of infarctions and may be less prominent than in the peripheral nervous system. <br> Egensperger et al. (1996) determined the apoE allele frequencies in 35 subjects with neuropathologically confirmed Lewy body parkinsonism with and without concomitant Alzheimer lesions, 27 patients with AD, and 54 controls. They concluded that the apoE4 allele does not function as a risk factor which influences the development of AD lesions in PD. <br> Myers et al. (1996) examined the association of apolipoprotein E4 with Alzheimer disease and other dementias in 1,030 elderly individuals in the Framingham Study cohort. They found an increased risk for Alzheimer disease as well as other dementias in patients who were homozygous or heterozygous for E4. However, they pointed out that most apoE4 carriers do not develop dementia, and about one-half of Alzheimer disease is not associated with apoE4. <br> In aggregate, the association studies on apoE in Alzheimer disease suggest epsilon-4 accelerates the neurodegenerative process in Alzheimer disease. However, in 3 independent studies, Kurz et al. (1996), Growdon et al. (1996), and Asada et al. (1996) found no differences in the clinical rate of decline of newly diagnosed Alzheimer disease patients with or without the epsilon-4 allele. <br> Bickeboller et al. (1997) confirmed the increased risk for AD associated with the APOE4 allele in 417 patients compared with 1,030 control subjects. When compared to the APOE3 allele, the authors demonstrated an increased risk associated with the APOE4 allele (odds ratio = 2.7) and a protective effect of the APOE2 allele (odds ratio = 0.5). An effect of E4 allele dosage on susceptibility was confirmed: the odds ratio of E4/E4 versus E3/E3 = 11.2; odds ratio of E3/E4 versus E3/E3 = 2.2. In E3/E4 individuals, sex-specific lifetime risk estimates by age 85 years (i.e., sex-specific penetrances by age 85 years) were 0.14 for men and 0.17 for women. Houlden et al. (1998) found that the APOE genotype is only a risk factor for early-onset AD families with no lesion detectable in the presenilin or APP gene. <br> Meyer et al. (1998) presented data on an elderly population which suggested that apoE genotype influences the age-specific risk of Alzheimer disease but that, regardless of apoE genotype, more than half of the population will not develop AD by age 100. ApoE genotype did not appear to influence whether subjects will develop AD, but the study did confirm that the apoE4 alleles influence when susceptible individuals will develop AD. The findings could be explained by a gene or genes independent of apoE that condition vulnerability. <br> Wiebusch et al. (1999) conducted a case-control study of 135 pathologically confirmed AD cases and 70 non-AD controls (age of death greater than or equal to 60 years) in whom they genotyped for APOE epsilon-4 and BCHE-K (177400.0005). The allelic frequency of BCHE-K was 0.13 in controls and 0.23 in cases, giving a carrier odds ratio of 2.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-4.1) for BCHE-K in confirmed AD. In an older subsample of 27 controls and 89 AD cases with ages of death greater than or equal to 75 years, the carrier odds ratio increased to 4.5 (95% CI 1.4-15) for BCHE-K. The BCHE-K association with AD became even more prominent in carriers of APOE epsilon-4. Only 3 of 19 controls compared with 39 of 81 cases carried both, giving an odds ratio of 5.0 (95% CI 1.3-19) for BCHE-K carriers within APOE epsilon-4 carriers. The authors concluded that the BCHE-K polymorphism is a susceptibility factor for AD and enhances the AD risk from APOE epsilon-4 in an age-dependent manner. <br> Myeloperoxidase (MPO; 606989) is a potent oxidant found in immune cells that has been detected in activated microglial macrophages and within amyloid plaques. Using statistical analysis, Reynolds et al. (2000) examined the relationship between APOE and MPO polymorphisms in the risk of AD in a genetically homogeneous Finnish population. They found that the presence of the MPO A allele in conjunction with APOE4 significantly increased the risk of AD in men, but not in women (odds ratio for men with both alleles = 11.4 vs APOE4 alone = 3.0). Reynolds et al. (2000) also found that estrogen receptor-alpha (133430) binds to the MPO A promoter, which may explain the gender differences. <br> Goldstein et al. (2001) genotyped 71 African American patients with presumed AD and found that each copy of the E4 allele was associated with a 3.6-year earlier onset of disease. The results fit a clear linear dose-response relationship, with mean age of onset being 77.9 years with no E4 alleles, 74.3 years with 1 allele, and 70.7 years with 2 alleles. <br> Mortensen and Hogh (2001) tested 139 subjects without dementia with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and several performance tests at the ages of 50, 60, 70, and 80 years and found that there was a significant association between APOE4 genotype and decline in performance tests in women between 70 and 80 years, but not in men. These findings corroborated previous findings of gender differences in the association of APOE genotype and risk of AD. <br> Multiple reports have linked APOE promoter polymorphisms to AD, both in association with and independent of APOE alleles, yielding overall conflicting results. Wang et al. (2000) analyzed 3 promoter polymorphisms in 237 patients and 274 controls and found a strong association between -491 AA genotype and AD, in both E4 and non-E4 carriers. They also confirmed the well-described association between APOE4 and AD. Wang et al. (2000) proposed a mechanistic model of disease in which the level of expression of APOE in addition to the specific isoform of APOE influences the deposition of beta-amyloid. <br> Ghebremedhin et al. (2001) examined 729 routine autopsy brains for the classic neuropathologic findings in AD, namely intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and extracellular senile plaques (SP), to determine the effect of APOE genotype on the development of lesions. Presence of the APOE4 allele was significantly associated with both NFT and SP, but was differentially modified by age and gender: the effect of the E4 allele on NFT was noted at ages 80 and above, but not between ages 60 to 79, in both genders, whereas the association between the E4 allele and SP for women was found only between ages 60 to 79 years, but not above 80 years, with no age difference in men. <br> Bonay and Avila (2001) presented evidence that apoE, particularly apoE4, adds to neuroblastoma cells in culture and stimulates sulfate incorporation on cell and extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycans. They hypothesized that elevated levels of sulfated glycosaminoglycans could facilitate the assembly of beta-amyloid and tau proteins in the plaques and tangles of AD. <br> Lambert et al. (2001) measured amyloid-beta load immunohistochemically in regions 8 and 9 of Brodman's area in 74 people with Alzheimer disease. The amount of deposited amyloid-beta-40 was significantly increased in Alzheimer disease brain samples carrying at least one APOE4 allele, compared with samples that did not (p = 0.005). There was also an increase in amyloid-beta-40 load in individuals carrying the -491AA genotype independent of E4 status. On the basis of these findings, Lambert et al. (2001) suggested that the association between increased amyloid-beta load and alleles of the APOE promoter polymorphisms is independent of APOE genotype. <br> Zubenko et al. (2001) described a prospective, longitudinal, double-blind assessment of the age-specific risk of AD encountered by 325 asymptomatic first-degree relatives of AD probands who carried the D10S1423 234-bp allele (see 606187), the APOE4 allele, or both, after 11.5 years of systematic follow-up. They found that with the best-fitting model, only individuals who carried both risk alleles exhibited a risk ratio that differed significantly from 1. After controlling for these genotypes, female gender was also significantly associated with increased risk of developing AD. <br> Peskind et al. (2001) suggested that the effects of APOE genotype on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may be involved in the pathobiology of AD. They examined APOE genotype and CSF cortisol levels in 64 subjects with Alzheimer disease and 34 controls and found that higher cortisol levels were associated with increased frequency of the E4 allele and decreased frequency of the E2 allele. They noted that previous animal studies had shown a correlation between glucocorticoid elevation and hippocampal dendritic atrophy and neuronal loss, and postulated that increased cortisol levels in patients with AD may lower the threshold for neuronal degeneration. Wilkinson and Peskind (2001) explicitly described the modifications they made to the commercial cortisol assay protocol used to detect the low concentrations of cortisol in the CSF in their study. <br> Scarmeas et al. (2002) followed 87 patients with early-stage AD for up to 10 years to determine whether APOE genotype was related to the incidence of psychiatric symptomatology. They found that the presence of 1 E4 allele conferred a 2.5-fold risk and the presence of 2 E4 alleles conferred a 5.6-fold risk for development of delusions. The associations were significant even after controlling for variables. No association was found for depressive symptoms or behavioral disturbances. <br> In a longitudinal study of 55 patients with Alzheimer disease, Mori et al. (2002) determined that the rate of hippocampal atrophy was significantly greater in those with an APOE4 allele, and that the rate became more severe as the number of E4 alleles increased. However, their data did not support the findings of previous studies that the E4 allele is associated with an increased rate of cognitive decline. <br> Dal Forno et al. (2002) genotyped 125 patients with Alzheimer disease for the APOE allele and followed the participants for 10 years. They found that the APOE4 allele was associated with shorter survival in men, but not in women. <br> Among 1,732 patients with Alzheimer disease, Lambert et al. (2002) found that the -491AA and -219TT APOE genotypes were associated with increased risk for Alzheimer disease (odds ratio for -491AA was 1.7 and for -219TT was 1.6), with age accentuating the effect of the -219TT genotype. The authors concluded that because these polymorphisms appear to influence ApoE levels, the results suggest that APOE expression is an important determinant of AD pathogenesis. <br> Using logistic and linear regression statistical analysis to examine clinical, pathologic, and genetic data from 128 older persons (51 with probable AD and 77 without dementia), Bennett et al. (2003) determined that the E4 allele was strongly associated with the likelihood of clinical AD (odds ratio = 3.46) and decreased level of cognitive function. However, controlling for the effect of AD pathology, including neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, attenuated the associations, rendering them no longer significant. Bennett et al. (2003) concluded that the E4 allele is associated with the clinical manifestations of AD through an association with the pathologic hallmarks of AD rather than via some other mechanism. <br> In a study of 966 Swedish patients 75 years of age or older, Qiu et al. (2003) found that 204 were diagnosed with AD during a 6-year period. Presence of the APOE4 allele, high systolic blood pressure (140 mm Hg or greater), and low diastolic blood pressure (less than 70 mm Hg) were each associated with an increased risk of AD. APOE4 allele combined with low diastolic pressure greatly increased the risk of AD independent of antihypertensive drug use. Antihypertensive medication significantly reduced the risk of AD regardless of APOE4 status and counteracted the combined risk effect of the APOE4 allele and high blood pressure on the disease. <br> Among 563 AD patients and 118 controls, Prince et al. (2004) found that presence of the APOE4 allele was strongly associated with reduced CSF levels of beta-amyloid-42 in both patients and controls. The findings suggested an involvement of ApoE in beta-amyloid metabolism. <br> In a postmortem analysis of 296 AD brains, including 149 with 1 E4 allele, 38 with 2 E4 alleles, and 109 non-E4 carriers, Tiraboschi et al. (2004) found that patients with 2 E4 alleles had significantly more neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in all neocortical regions compared to those with 1 or no E4 alleles. There were no significant differences in neocortical cholinergic activity, as measured by tissue CHAT (118490) activity, between those with and without the E4 allele. Patients with the E2 allele had significantly decreased numbers of neuritic plaques in all neocortical regions, consistent with a putative protective effect of the E2 allele in AD. Tiraboschi et al. (2004) suggested that a single E4 allele does not influence neuropathologic severity in AD. <br> Huang et al. (2004) reported that 203 of 907 Swedish individuals over the age of 75 years developed AD over a period of 6 years. Analysis of the APOE allele genotype showed that individuals with at least 2 affected first-degree relatives or sibs had a significantly increased risk of disease development only in the presence of the E4 allele. <br> Bray et al. (2004) applied highly quantitative measures of allele discrimination to cortical RNA from individuals heterozygous for the APOE E2, E3, and E4 alleles. A small, but significant, increase in the expression of E4 allele was observed relative to that of the E3 and E2 alleles (P less than 0.0001). Similar differences were observed in brain tissue from confirmed late-onset Alzheimer disease subjects, and between cortical regions BA10 (frontopolar) and BA20 (inferior temporal). Stratification of E4/E3 allelic expression ratios according to heterozygosity for the -219G-T promoter polymorphism (107741.0030) revealed significantly lower relative expression of haplotypes containing the -219T allele (P = 0.02). Bray et al. (2004) concluded that, in human brain, most of the cis-acting variance in APOE expression may be accounted for by the E4 haplotype, but there are additional small cis-acting influences associated with the promoter genotype. <br> Tsuang et al. (2005) found a higher frequency of the E4 allele among 74 patients with the Lewy body variant of AD (see 127750) compared to 57 patients with AD without Lewy bodies (47.3% vs 35.1%, respectively). The findings suggested an association between the E4 allele and the development of Lewy bodies. <br> In a study of 140 elderly Nigerian patients with dementia, of which 123 were diagnosed with AD, Gureje et al. (2006) found no association between the APOE4 allele and dementia or AD. <br> Among 184 healthy individual with normal cognition aged 21 to 88 years, Peskind et al. (2006) found that the concentration of CSF beta-amyloid-42, but not beta-amyloid-40, decreased with age. Those with an APOE4 allele showed a sharp and significant decline in CSF beta-A-42 beginning in the sixth decade compared to those without the APOE4 allele. The findings were consistent with APOE4-modulated acceleration of pathogenic beta-A-42 deposition starting in late middle age in persons with normal cognition, and suggested that early treatment for AD in susceptible individuals may be necessary in midlife or earlier. <br> Among 100 patients with AD, van der Flier et al. (2006) found an association between presence of the E4 allele and the typical amnestic phenotype, characterized by initial presentation of forgetfulness and difficulties with memory. Those with the memory phenotype were 3 times more likely to carry an E4 allele compared to AD patients who displayed a nonmemory phenotype, with initial complaints including problems with calculation, agnosia, and apraxia. The memory phenotype was almost exclusively observed in homozygous E4 carriers. <br> Borroni et al. (2007) also reported an association between the memory phenotype of AD and presence of the E4 allele. Among 319 late-onset AD patients, 77.6% of E4 allele carriers presented with the memory phenotype compared to 64.6% of noncarriers. <br> Among 51 patients with probable AD and 31 patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD; 600274), Agosta et al. (2009) found that presence of the E4 allele was associated with greater brain atrophy on imaging studies. AD E4 allele carriers showed greater atrophy in the bilateral parietal cortex and right hippocampus, whereas FTD E4 allele carriers demonstrated greater atrophy in the bilateral medial, dorsolateral, and orbital frontal cortex, anterior insula, and cingulate cortex with right predominance. The regional effect was consistent with the hypothesis that APOE may affect morphologic expression uniquely in different neurodegenerative diseases, and that E4 carriers are at greater risk for clinical progression. <br> - Role in Cognitive Impairment <br> Reiman et al. (1996) found that in late middle age, cognitively normal subjects who were homozygous for the APOE4 allele had reduced glucose metabolism in the same regions of the brain as in patients with probable Alzheimer disease. These findings provided preclinical evidence that the presence of the APOE4 allele is a risk factor for Alzheimer disease. Positron-emission tomography (PET) was used in these studies; Reiman et al. (1996) suggested that PET may offer a relatively rapid way of testing treatments to prevent Alzheimer disease in the future. <br> Blesa et al. (1996) found an apoE epsilon-4 frequency of 0.315 in patients with age-related memory decline without dementia, similar to the 0.293 allele frequency found in an Alzheimer disease group. This contrasted to the frequency of 0.057 found in their control group. Payami et al. (1997) reported the results of a prospective case-control study that enlisted 114 Caucasian subjects who were physically healthy and cognitively intact at age 75 years and who were followed, for an average of 4 years, with neurologic, psychometric, and neuroimaging examinations. Excellent health at entry did not protect against cognitive decline. Incidence of cognitive decline rose sharply with age. E4 and a family history of dementia (independent of E4) were associated with an earlier age at onset of dementia. Subjects who had E4 or a family history of dementia had a 9-fold-higher age-specific risk for dementia than did those who had neither. From these observations, Payami et al. (1997) suggested that the rate of cognitive decline increases with age and that APOE and other familial/genetic factors influence the onset age throughout life. <br> Yaffe et al. (2000) studied 2,716 women 65 years of age or older by cognitive testing on 2 or more visits. They analyzed change in score on the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination as a function of estrogen use, APOE genotype, and baseline common and internal carotid artery wall thickening. A total of 297 (11%) women were current estrogen users, and 336 (12%) were past estrogen users. Over the 6-year average follow-up, baseline current users declined 1.5 points, whereas women who had never used estrogen declined 2.7 points (P = 0.023). Compared with APOE4-negative women, APOE4-positive women had a greater adjusted hazard ratio of cognitive impairment. There was an interaction between estrogen use and APOE4 presence. Among APOE4-negative women, current estrogen use reduced the risk of adjusted cognitive impairment by almost half compared with the risk of those who had never used estrogen, whereas it did not reduce the risk among APOE4-positive women. Compared with never having used estrogen, current estrogen use was associated with less internal and common carotid wall thickening in APOE4-negative women but not in APOE4-positive women. Differences remained after adjusting for age, education, race, and stroke. Yaffe et al. (2000) concluded that estrogen use was associated with less cognitive decline among women who did not have the APOE4 allele but not among women who had at least one APOE4 allele. <br> Cohen et al. (2001) examined 25 healthy women with normal cognition above the age of 50 in a longitudinal 2-year study and found that a single APOE4 allele was associated with a significant decrease in hippocampal volume (mean 2.3% decrease per year), as measured by MRI, compared to the APOE4-negative group (mean 0.77% decrease per year). These results suggested that brain structural changes may be associated with the E4 genotype and that the changes may precede the development of cognitive deficits. <br> In a 6-year longitudinal study of 611 participants aged 65 years or older, Wilson et al. (2002) found that presence of the APOE E4 allele was associated with a more rapid decline in cognitive functions, particularly episodic memory, which is an early and defining clinical characteristic of AD. To identify the determinants of normal age-related cognitive change, Deary et al. (2002) genotyped 466 healthy subjects who had taken the Moray House Test (MHT) to measure cognitive ability in 1932 at age 11 and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at age 80. Possession of the APOE4 allele was found to be unrelated to differences in mental ability in youth, but was significantly associated with decreased mental ability in old age and the change in ability score from youth. <br> In a cohort of 180 asymptomatic individuals with a mean age of 60 years, Caselli et al. (2004) found that carriers of an E4 allele showed greater declines in memory performance over a median period of 33 months compared to those without an E4 allele. Among 494 individuals with mild cognitive impairment, Farlow et al. (2004) found an association between the E4 allele and worse scores on cognition tests as well as smaller total hippocampal volume. Among 6,202 Caucasian middle-aged individuals (47 to 68 years), Blair et al. (2005) found that carriers of the E4 allele had greater cognitive decline over a 6-year period compared to those without an E4 allele. Results for 1,693 African American patients were inconclusive. <br> Among 136 patients with mild cognitive impairment, 35 of whom developed AD, Devanand et al. (2005) found no association between APOE4 carrier status and development of AD or further cognitive decline. After controlling for known demographic and clinical risk factors, E4 carrier status was associated with conversion to AD only in patients older than 70 years. <br> Using EEG to study 89 patients with mild cognitive impairment and 103 with AD, Babiloni et al. (2006) found that the amplitude of alpha sources in occipital, temporal, and limbic areas was lower in patients with the E4 allele compared to those not carrying the E4 allele. <br> Caselli et al. (2009) presented evidence that the APOE E4 allele affects age-related memory performance independently of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. A longitudinal study of 815 individuals, including 317 E4 carriers (79 homozygous subjects and 238 heterozygous subjects) and 498 E4 noncarriers, showed that carriers of the E4 allele had a decline in memory beginning in their fifties compared to noncarriers (p = 0.03). Noncarriers showed a decline in memory beginning in their seventies. The findings indicated that carriers of the E4 allele may have increased age-related memory decline and decreased visuospatial function. <br> In a prospective population-based study of 516 individuals aged 85 years from the Netherlands, van Vliet et al. (2009) found an association between high serum calcium and decreased cognitive function in APOE E3/E4 carriers and to a lesser extent in E3/E3 carriers, but not in E2/E3 carriers. The p value for interaction between APOE genotype and serum calcium levels corrected for confounders was 0.025; the p value for interaction between APOE genotype and serum calcium level in relation to global cognitive function over time was 0.011. The findings suggested that APOE genotype modulates an association between serum calcium and cognitive function in old age. <br> - Role in Multiple Sclerosis  <br> Chapman et al. (2001) reported on 205 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS; 126200) and found that the APOE4 allele was associated with significantly faster progression of disability. The effect was significant after adjustment for sex and age of onset. Although the E4 allele was associated with slightly earlier disease onset, there was no support for the E4 allele being a risk factor for development of MS. <br> Noting that the APOE4 allele has been associated with earlier age of onset in AD, but not disease progression, and with faster disease progression in MS, but not age of onset, Chapman et al. (2001) suggested that these apparent effects are influenced by whether the diagnosis is made late in disease course (as in AD) or relatively early in disease course (as in MS). The authors hypothesized that the APOE4 genotype influences neuronal disease in general via alterations in the efficacy of neuronal maintenance and repair, and that the apparent effects of the genotype on these 2 parameters are related to the threshold at which the disease manifests itself clinically. <br> In MS, a reduction in concentration of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), which has been shown to be contained almost exclusively in mature neurons, reflects neuronal loss, axonal loss, and generalized neuronal dysfunction. Moreover, the degree of reduction of NAA has been correlated with disease severity and extent of tissue destruction. In 72 patients with relapsing-remitting MS, Enzinger et al. (2003) showed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) that patients with the APOE4 allele had a higher degree of disability and a significantly lower NAA:creatine ratio than patients without the E4 allele. During follow-up in 44 patients, the drop in the NAA:creatine ratio of E4 carriers was significantly larger and was paralleled by a higher number of relapses and a faster disease progression. Enzinger et al. (2003) concluded that the findings indicated more extensive axonal damage associated with the APOE4 allele. <br> Kantarci et al. (2004) presented evidence suggesting that the APOE2 allele is associated with lesser disease severity in women with MS, as indicated by a longer time to reach an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score of 6. In contrast, Zwemmer et al. (2004) reported no favorable role for the E2 allele in a study of 250 women with MS. In fact, they found a trend in the opposite direction: time to an EDSS score of 6 was shorter (6.8 years) in E2 carriers than in noncarriers (10.0 years). In addition, E2 carriers had a higher lesion load on MRI compared to noncarriers. In a response, Weinshenker and Kantarci (2004) noted that the study by Zwemmer et al. (2004) had a higher number of more severe primary progressive cases (22% of subjects) than that reported by Kantarci et al. (2004) (6.4% of subjects), which may explain the discrepancy. <br> Enzinger et al. (2004) noted that decreases in brain size and volume in patients with MS are related to neuroaxonal injury and loss, and are a useful surrogate marker of tissue damage and disease progression. In a study of 99 patients with MS, the authors found that patients who carried an E4 allele had more relapses during the study period and had a 5-fold higher rate of annual brain volume loss compared to patients without the E4 allele. Over time, E4 carriers also had an increase in individual lesions on MRI, termed 'black holes.' Among all genotype groups, the lowest annual loss of brain volume occurred in patients with an E2 allele. Among 76 patients with relapsing-remitting MS, de Stefano et al. (2004) found that carriers of the E4 allele showed significantly lower total brain volumes compared to MS patients without the E4 alleles. There was no difference in lesion volume between the 2 groups. The authors suggested that the E4 allele is linked to impaired mechanisms of cell repair and severe tissue destruction in MS. <br> Among 125 Greek MS patients, Koutsis et al. (2007) found that E4 carriers had a 6-fold increase in the relative risk of verbal learning deficits compared to noncarriers. The effect was specific and was not observed in other cognitive domains. <br> Among 1,006 Australian patients with relapsing-remitting MS or secondary progressive MS, van der Walt et al. (2009) found no association between APOE allele status or promoter region heterogeneity at positions -219G-T (dbSNP rs405509; 107741.0030) or +113C-G (dbSNP rs440446) and clinical disease severity, cognition, or cerebral atrophy. <br> Ghaffar et al. (2010) found no differences in 11 cognitive outcome variables, including attention, processing speed, verbal and visual memory, and executive functions in a comparision of 50 MS patients with the E4 allele and 50 MS patients without the E4 allele who were well-matched regarding education and disease course and duration. The presence of cognitive impairment overall was 41%. <br> - Role in Traumatic Brain Injury <br> Among 89 patients with head injury, Teasdale et al. (1997) found that patients with the E4 allele were more likely than those without the E4 allele to have an unfavorable outcome 6 months after head injury. The authors discussed the role of the apoE protein in response to acute brain injury. In a prospective study of 69 patients with severe blunt trauma to the head, Friedman et al. (1999) found an odds ratio of 5.69 for more than 7 days of unconsciousness and 13.93 for a suboptimal neurologic outcome at 6 months for individuals with an APOE4 allele compared to those without that allele. <br> In 110 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), Crawford et al. (2002) tested memory and other cognitive variables and found that patients with the APOE4 allele had more difficulty with memory than matched patients without the E4 allele. In those with the E4 allele, performance was poor regardless of severity of injury, whereas in those without the E4 allele, performance worsened with more severe injury. Crawford et al. (2002) noted that TBI may result in greater damage to the medial temporal lobe structures involved in memory and suggested a role for the APOE protein in neuronal repair. <br> In 87 patients with mild to moderate TBI, Liberman et al. (2002) used neuropsychologic testing to examine whether the APOE4 genotype affected short-term recovery. At 6 weeks, E4-positive patients had lower mean scores on 11 of 13 tests, but the differences from the E4-negative group were smaller than the differences observed at 3 weeks. Although Liberman et al. (2002) stated that the findings are consistent with delayed recovery among E4-positive TBI patients, perhaps due to interactions with beta-amyloid, they cautioned against the generalizability of the results. <br> Among 60 patients with TBI with a mean follow-up of 31 years, Koponen et al. (2004) found that presence of the E4 allele increased the risk for dementia, but there was no association between the E4 allele and development of other psychiatric illnesses, including depression, anxiety, psychosis, or personality disorders. <br> - Role in Other Neurologic Disorders <br> Saunders et al. (1993) found no association of E4 with other amyloid-forming diseases, i.e., Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD; 123400), familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, and Down syndrome (190685). On the other hand, Amouyel et al. (1994) concluded that E4 is a major susceptibility factor for CJD. They found a relative risk of CJD between subjects with at least one E4 allele and subjects with none to range between 1.8 and 4.2, depending on the control group used. A variation in disease duration was also noted, depending on apoE genotype, with an increase in duration of illness in E2 allele carriers. <br> Frisoni et al. (1994) assessed the apoE allele frequency in 51 elderly control subjects, 23 subjects with vascular dementia, and 93 patients with Alzheimer disease. There was increased frequency of the E4 allele both in Alzheimer disease and in vascular dementia with respect to both elderly and young control subjects. There was no difference in the proportion of E2, E3, and E4 frequency in Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia patients. Slooter et al. (1996) compared E4 allele frequency between 185 patients with Alzheimer disease and those with other types of dementia. The authors found little predictive value in distinguishing Alzheimer patients from those with other forms of dementia using APOE genotyping. In contrast, Mahieux et al. (1994) found an increase of E4 in Alzheimer disease, but not in vascular dementia. They speculated that the difference between their results and those of Frisoni et al. (1994) may be attributable to the small size of the groups or to the different mean ages of the populations that they studied. <br> McCarron et al. (1999) performed a metaanalysis that demonstrated a significantly higher frequency of E4 carriers in individuals with ischemic cerebrovascular disease than in control subjects (odds ratio, 1.73). <br> Tabaton et al. (1995) found that although apolipoprotein E immunoreactivity was associated with neurofibrillary tangles in an autopsy study of 12 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (601104), the apolipoprotein E allele frequency was similar to that of age-matched controls. Farrer et al. (1995) demonstrated that the number of epsilon-4 alleles was inversely related to the age at onset of Pick disease (172700). Their results suggested that epsilon-4 may be a susceptibility factor for dementia and not specifically for AD. <br> Mui et al. (1995) found no association between apolipoprotein E4 and the incidence or the age of onset of sporadic or autosomal dominant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (105400). Garlepp et al. (1995) found an increased frequency of the epsilon 4 allele in patients with inclusion body myositis (147421) compared with that in patients with other inflammatory muscle diseases or that in the general population. <br> In a study of apoE genotypes in schizophrenic patients coming to autopsy, Harrington et al. (1995) found that schizophrenia is associated with an increased E4 allele frequency. The E4 allele frequency in schizophrenia was indistinguishable from that found in either Alzheimer disease or Lewy body dementia (127750). From the age range at autopsy (from 19 to 95 years), they determined that the epsilon-4 frequency was not associated with increased age. <br> Betard et al. (1994) analyzed allele frequencies of apoE in 166 autopsied French-Canadian patients with dementia. The E4 frequency was highest in Lewy body dementia (0.472); presenile Alzheimer disease (0.405); senile Alzheimer disease (0.364); and Alzheimer disease with cerebrovascular disease (0.513). In contrast, the E4 allele frequency was 0.079 in autopsied cases of individuals with vascular dementia but no changes of Alzheimer disease. Subjects with vascular dementia demonstrated an increased relative E2 allele frequency of 0.211 compared to 0.144 in elderly controls. In contradistinction to the findings of Betard et al. (1994), Lippa et al. (1995) found much lower frequency of E4, 0.22, when they were careful to exclude Lewy body patients that had concurrent Alzheimer disease by the Cerat criterion. They did, however, find that a neuritic degeneration in CA2-3 was slightly greater in those Lewy body disease patients with the apoE4 allele than those with the E3/3 genotype. Hyman et al. (1995) found that senile plaques in the Alzheimer disease of Down syndrome were abnormally large, whereas those of APOE4-related Alzheimer disease were unusually numerous. The findings suggested that the pathology in Down syndrome is due to increased amyloid production and deposition, whereas that in APOE4, disease is related to an increased probability of senile plaque initiation. Royston et al. (1994) assessed the apoE genotype in elderly Down syndrome patients and found that the epsilon-2 variant was associated both with increased longevity and a significantly decreased frequency of Alzheimer-type dementia. They noted that none of their elderly Down patients was homozygous for the epsilon-4 allele. <br> In a case-control study of apoE genotypes in Alzheimer disease associated with Down syndrome, van Gool et al. (1995) showed that the frequencies of apoE type 2, 3, or 4 were not significantly different in Down syndrome cases with Alzheimer disease compared with aged-matched Down syndrome controls. The apoE4 frequency in Down syndrome cases with Alzheimer disease was significantly lower than in any other Alzheimer disease populations studied thus far, suggesting that apoE4 does not significantly affect the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease in Down syndrome patients. <br> Kehoe et al. (1999) showed that the APOE epsilon-2/epsilon-3 genotype is associated with significantly earlier age of onset of Huntington disease (143100) in males than in females. This sex difference was not apparent for any other APOE genotypes. <br> Greenberg et al. (1995) found that the presence of apolipoprotein E4 significantly increased the odds ratio for moderate or severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA; see 605714), even after controlling for the presence of Alzheimer disease. Yamada et al. (1996) reported a lack of association between the E4 allele and CAA in elderly Japanese patients. Nicoll et al. (1996, 1997) did not find an association between the E4 allele and CAA-related hemorrhage. However, they did find a high frequency of the E2 allele in patients with CAA-related hemorrhage, regardless of the presence of AD. The authors suggested that patients with the E2 allele may be protected from parenchymal AD but may be susceptible to the rupture of amyloid-laden vessels. <br> In a postmortem study, Greenberg et al. (1998) found an association between apolipoprotein E2 and vasculopathy in cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Of 75 brains with complete amyloid replacement of vessel walls, only 23 had accompanying signs of hemorrhage in cracks of the vessel wall. The frequency of apolipoprotein E2 was significantly higher in the group with vasculopathy. The authors suggested that apolipoprotein E2 and E4 might promote hemorrhage through separate mechanisms: E4 by enhancing amyloid deposition and E2 by promoting rupture. <br> O'Donnell et al. (2000) identified a specific apolipoprotein E genotype as a risk factor for early recurrence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy: carriers of the E2 (107741.0001) or E4 (107741.0016) allele had an increased risk for early recurrence compared to individuals with the E3/E3 (107741.0015) genotype. <br> Fetal iodine deficiency disorder (FIDD; 228355) is the principal form of endemic cretinism, and the most common cause of preventable mental deficiency in the world. Not everyone at risk develops FIDD and familial aggregation is common, suggesting that genetic factors may be involved. The APOE gene encodes a lipoprotein that possesses a thyroid hormone-binding domain, and the APOE genotype might affect the efficiency with which thyroid hormone influences neuronal cell growth during the first and second trimesters of fetal development. For this reason, Wang et al. (2000) compared APOE genotypes in 91 FIDD cases with those of 154 local control subjects, recruited from 3 iodine deficiency areas in central China. They also genotyped 42 FIDD family cases and 158 normal individuals from the families of local controls, and 375 population controls from Shanghai. APOE4 genotypes were significantly enriched in FIDD probands from each of the 3 iodine deficiency areas; the E4 allele frequency was 16% versus 6% in controls. They suggested that this phenomenon may affect population selection and contribute to the low frequency of the APOE4 allele in Chinese compared with Caucasian populations. <br> Using nocturnal polysomnography in a study of 791 middle-aged adults, Kadotani et al. (2001) found that the probability of moderate to severe sleep-disordered breathing (apnea/hypopnea) was significantly higher in persons with apoE4, independent of age, sex, body mass index, and ethnicity. See sleep apnea (107650). <br> In a study of 1,775 individuals, Gottlieb et al. (2004) found an age-dependent association between the E4 allele and obstructive sleep apnea. E4 carriers younger than 65 years had an odds ratio of 3.08 for sleep apnea, whereas E4 carriers 65 years of age or older had an odds ratio of 1.25. The association was stronger in those with hypertension or cardiovascular disease. <br> Among 18 older adult APOE4 carriers with obstructive sleep apnea, O'Hara et al. (2005) found an association between greater numbers of respiratory events and lower memory performance. No association was found in 18 older adult noncarriers with sleep apnea. The authors suggested that sleep apnea may partly account for the association of the E4 allele and cognitive decline in community-dwelling older adults and postulated that hypoxia may have a role in neuronal vulnerability to oxidative stress. <br> In a study of 79 patients with Parkinson disease, 22 of whom were demented, Marder et al. (1994) found that the E4 allele frequency was 0.13 in patients without dementia and 0.068 in those with dementia as opposed to a control value of 0.102. The authors concluded that the biologic basis for dementia in Parkinson disease differs from that of Alzheimer disease. <br> Zareparsi et al. (2002) examined the effect of the APOE genotypes on age at onset of Parkinson disease using a population of 521 unrelated Caucasian patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease from movement disorder clinics in Oregon and Washington. They found that age at onset was significantly earlier in E3E4/E4E4 patients (mean onset 56.1 years) than in E3E3 patients (mean onset 59.6 years) (p = 0.003). This earlier onset was not influenced by effects of recruitment site, family history, or gender on onset of Parkinson disease. <br> Li et al. (2004) presented evidence suggesting that the E4 allele increases disease risk for familial PD and is associated with earlier age at disease onset independent of cognitive impairment; however, the effect was not as strong as that observed in AD. In a review and metaanalysis of 22 studies, Huang et al. (2004) concluded that the E2 allele, but not the E4 allele, was positively associated with sporadic Parkinson disease. <br> Frikke-Schmidt et al. (2001) genotyped over 9,000 individuals and found no association between APOE genotype and ischemic cerebrovascular disease, defined as the sudden onset of focal neurologic symptoms. However, they did find an association between the genotype E4E3 and 'other dementia,' which included vascular dementia, alcohol-induced dementia, and unclassifiable dementia. They confirmed the findings of previous studies that APOE genotypes E4E3 and E4E4 are significant risk factors for AD. The increases in all dementia risks were independent of plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels. <br> Broderick et al. (2001) examined data from a tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA; 173370) trial and concluded that the efficacy of intravenous t-PA in patients with acute ischemic stroke, as measured by favorable outcome at 3 months, may be enhanced in those with an APOE E2 phenotype. <br> Verpillat et al. (2002) determined the APOE genotype frequencies in 94 unrelated patients with frontotemporal dementia (600274) and 392 age- and sex-matched controls without cognitive deficits or behavioral disturbances (after excluding 6 patients with autosomal dominant inheritance and mutation in the MAPT gene). Homozygosity for the E2E2 genotype was significantly associated with frontotemporal dementia (odds ratio = 11.3, P = 0.033, exact test) but was based on very few subjects (3 patients and 1 control). The result was even more significant in the group with a positive familial history (odds ratio = 23.8, P = 0.019, exact test). For the metaanalysis of the APOE polymorphism in frontotemporal dementia, Verpillat et al. (2002) pooled 10 case-control studies with available genotype or allele information (total of 364 patients and 2,671 controls), but the E2E2 genotype did not reach statistical significance. Because of heterogeneity, Verpillat et al. (2002) analyzed on one hand the neuropathologically-confirmed studies, and on the other hand the clinical-based studies. A significant increase in the E2 allele frequency was found in the neuropathologically-confirmed patients, and heterogeneity disappeared (Mantel-Haenszel statistics). The authors concluded that the APOE E2 allele may be a risk factor for frontotemporal dementia, but that the data should be interpreted with caution due to the rarity of the E2E2 genotype. <br> Matsumoto et al. (2003) provided evidence suggesting that patients with primary dystonia who have the APOE4 genotype have an earlier age at disease onset than APOE4 noncarriers with dystonia, which they suggested was caused in part by a defect in neuronal repair in those with the APOE4 allele. <br> In a large population-based study of 9,294 French individuals, Dufouil et al. (2005) found a decreased risk for the development of non-AD dementia among those who used lipid lowering agents and maintained normal lipid levels. The odds for non-AD dementia were increased in subjects with hyperlipidemia. The findings were not modified by APOE genotype. <br> Among 32 patients with a clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia, including 15 patient with primary progressive aphasia, Acciarri et al. (2006) found increased frequency of the E2 and E4 alleles and significantly decreased frequency of the E3 allele compared to 87 control individuals. The E2E4 genotype in particular was significantly associated with primary progressive aphasia. <br> Among 87 patients with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy necessitating temporal lobectomy, Busch et al. (2007) found that the presence of the E4 allele was associated with significantly reduced verbal and nonverbal memory in those with a long duration of epilepsy (greater than 22 years), particularly in those with an earlier age at onset. Busch et al. (2007) suggested that medically refractory seizures are similar to traumatic brain injury and that neuronal recovery after seizures may be impaired by the presence of the E4 allele. Surgery had no significant effects on the results. <br> In a metaanalysis including 8 published studies comprising 696 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, Lanterna et al. (2007) found that patients with the E4 allele had approximately 2-fold increased risk of negative outcome and delayed ischemia compared to those without the allele. <br> Gozal et al. (2007) found that the E4 allele was more common in nonobese children with obstructive sleep apnea (107650) compared to controls, and particularly in those who developed neurocognitive deficits. <br> - Role in Ocular Disorders  <br> Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG; 137760) is an optic neuropathy that has a high worldwide prevalence and that shows strong evidence of complex inheritance. The myocilin gene (MYOC; 601652) has been shown to have mutations in patients with POAG. Apolipoprotein E plays an essential role in lipid metabolism, and the APOE gene has been involved in the neuronal degeneration that occurs in Alzheimer disease. Copin et al. (2002) reported that 2 APOE-promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with Alzheimer disease also modified the POAG phenotype. APOE(-219G) is associated with increased optic nerve damage, as reflected by increased cup:disc ratio and visual field alteration. In addition, APOE(-491T), interacting at a highly significant level with a SNP in the MYOC promoter, MYOC(-1000G), is associated with increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and with limited effectiveness of IOP-lowering treatments in patients with POAG. Together, these findings establish APOE as a potent modifier for POAG, which could explain the linkage to chromosome 19q previously observed by use of a genome scan for this condition (Wiggs et al., 2000) and an increased frequency of glaucoma in patients with Alzheimer disease (Bayer et al., 2002). The findings also shed new light on potential mechanisms of optic nerve damage and of IOP regulation in POAG. Bunce et al. (2003) criticized the statistical approach used by Copin et al. (2002) and concluded that without supportive clinical data, evidence is lacking that APOE SNPs either are associated with a more severe phenotype or interact at a highly significant level with a SNP in the MYOC promoter. <br> Zetterberg et al. (2007) studied the association of AD-associated APOE polymorphisms in 242 patients with POAG and 187 controls. They found no differences between patients and controls with regard to APOE genotypes. <br> Because clinical studies had shown an association between glaucoma and AD (Bayer et al., 2002), which is also a complex trait, Ressiniotis et al. (2004) examined DNA from 137 unrelated patients with POAG and 75 control subjects. In this cohort, APOE genotype did not constitute a risk factor for developing POAG, even in patients with normal tension glaucoma. The authors concluded that APOE polymorphisms did not appear to be contributory to POAG. <br> The inheritance of specific ApoE alleles is linked to the incidence of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD; see 603075). ApoE appears to be a ubiquitous component of drusen, which are the hallmark of ARMD irrespective of clinical phenotype. Anderson et al. (2001) found ApoE located at the same anatomic locus at which drusen are situated and suggested that the retinal pigment epithelium is the most likely local biosynthetic source of ApoE at that site. They concluded that age-related alteration of lipoprotein biosynthesis and/or processing at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium and/or Bruch membrane might be a significant contributing factor in drusen formation and ARMD pathogenesis. <br> Schultz et al. (2003) found no evidence to support an association between ARMD in medium to large families and the E4 or E2 alleles of ApoE. They also found no evidence for an association of ApoE polymorphisms in a set of unrelated patients with ARMD. They did, however, find a trend for a decreased risk of ARMD associated with ApoE4 in a set of unrelated patients with a family history of ARMD. <br> Baird et al. (2006) studied progression of ARMD in a cohort of 238 individuals from a single center. Individuals with an E2 genotype (526C-T; 107741.0001) of the APOE gene showed a strong association with disease with a significant 4.8-fold increased relative risk compared to individuals with an E4 genotype (388T-C; 107741.0016) (odds ratio, 4.8) and a nearly significant 3-fold increased relative risk compared to individuals with an E3 (107741.0015) genotype. This finding was present only in females who progressed with ARMD, which suggested that there may be a gender-specific role in progression of ARMD in individuals with an E2 allele. <br> Bojanowski et al. (2006) investigated the association between apoE2 (158C), apoE3, and apoE4 (112R) variants and ARMD in 133 clinically screened controls, 94 volunteers with a younger mean age, 120 patients with advanced ARMD, and 40 archived ocular ARMD slides. They also tested the effects of recombinant apoE variants on the expression of a chemokine (CCL2; 158105), a chemokine receptor (CX3CR1; 601470), and a cytokine (VEGF; 192240) in cultured human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and analyzed the serum cholesterol profiles of the clinically screened subjects. The apoE4 distribution differed significantly between ARMD patients and controls. The arg112 allele frequency was 10.9% in the ARMD group when compared with 16.5% in the younger controls and 18.8% in the clinically screened controls. The pathologically diagnosed archived ARMD cases had the lowest allele frequency of 5%. No significant differences in apoE2 distribution were observed among the groups. A metaanalysis of 8 cohorts, including 4,289 subjects, showed a strong association between ARMD and 112R, but not 158C. In vitro studies found that recombinant apoE suppressed CCL2 and VEGF expression in RPE cells. However, the E4 isoform showed more suppression than E3 in both cases. Bojanowski et al. (2006) concluded that these results further confirm the association between apoE4 and a decreased risk of ARMD development. They suggested that the underlying mechanisms may involve differential regulation of both CCL2 and VEGF by the apoE isoforms. <br>

AP sites resulting from loss of bases are the most frequent lesions occurring in vivo in cellular DNA. AP sites are known to be produced by spontaneous hydrolysis, by various chemicals and radiations, and by DNA glycosylases that remove particular abnormal bases from DNA.

GC-A and GC-B function as receptors for natriuretic peptides; they are also referred to as atrial natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPR1) and type B (NPR2; 108961). Also see NPR3 (108962), which encodes a protein with only the ligand-binding transmembrane and 37-amino acid cytoplasmic domains.

109730=><br> Bicuspid, or bicommissural, aortic valve (BAV) describes an aortic valve with 2 rather than 3 leaflets (Cripe et al., 2004). In 1 to 2% of the population a bicuspid aortic valve is present. Bicuspid aortic valve is frequently an antecedent to aortic valve stenosis or insufficiency. In extreme cases the blood flow may be so restricted that the left ventricle fails to grow, resulting in hypoplastic left heart syndrome (241550) (Garg et al., 2005). The valve calcification often observed in bicuspid aortic valve is a result of inappropriate activation of osteoblast-specific gene expression. Mutations in the signaling and transcription regulator NOTCH1 cause a spectrum of developmental aortic valve anomalies and severe valve calcification in nonsyndromic autosomal dominant human pedigrees. <br>

The proteins encoded by the A and B alleles of ABO differ minimally in amino acid sequence but catalyze the transfer of different carbohydrates (N-acetylgalactosamine or galactose) into the H antigen to form the A or B antigens. Individuals with the O blood group do not produce either the A or B antigens because of a single-base deletion. <br>

110700=><br> The Duffy blood group system, which consists of 4 alleles, 5 phenotypes, and 5 antigens, is important in clinical medicine because of transfusion incompatibilities and hemolytic disease of the newborn. Duffy antigens are located on DARC (613665), an acidic glycoprotein found on erythrocytes and other cells throughout the body. The 2 principal antigens, Fy(a) and Fy(b), are produced by the FYA and FYB codominant alleles (see 613665.0001). Four phenotypes are defined by the corresponding antibodies, anti-Fy(a) and anti-Fy(b): Fy(a+b-), Fy(a-b+), Fy(a+b+), and Fy(a-b-). Fy(a-b-), or Duffy null, is the major phenotype in African and American blacks and is characterized by the presence of Fy(b) on nonerythroid cells, but an absence of Fy(b) on erythrocytes. The Fy(a-b-) phenotype is associated with complete resistance to infection by the malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax (see 611162). Individuals with the Fy(a-b-) phenotype have the FYB-erythroid silent (FYB-ES) allele with a mutation in the DARC promoter (613665.0002). A fifth phenotype, Fy(bwk), or Fy(x), is characterized by weak Fy(b) expression on erythrocytes due to a reduced amount of protein. Individuals with the Fy(bwk) phenotype have the FYB-weak (FYB-WK) allele, also called the FYX allele, with a missense mutation in DARC (613665.0003). Other Duffy antigens include Fy3, Fy4, Fy5, and Fy6 (reviews by Pogo and Chaudhuri (2000), Langhi and Bordin (2006), and Meny (2010)). <br>

The Kell protein is a type II membrane glycoprotein sharing sequence homology with members of the M13 family of zinc-dependent metalloproteases and possessing enzymatic activity characteristic of that group (summary by Claperon et al., 2007). <br> The Kell blood group system is highly polymorphic, expressing over 25 antigens that have been classified in to 5 antithetical sets of high and low prevalence antigens with the others being independently expressed or having unknown antithetical partners. The different phenotypes are due to single-nucleotide mutations that result in an amino acid substitution (summary by Sha et al., 2006). See, for example, Kell (designated K or K1)/Cellano (k, K2) (T193M; 613883.0001). <br> Yu et al.

Since it is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, it was initially postulated to result from an inhibitor of the Lu antigen. However, Singleton et al. (2008) found that the phenotype results from a mutation in the transcription factor KLF1 that regulates expression of the BCAM gene. <br> For a discussion of Lutheran blood group phenotypes, see 247420. <br>
111200=><br> Lutheran is a complex blood group system consisting of 19 antigens numbered from LU1 to LU21, with 2 numbers (LU10 and LU15) declared obsolete. Four pairs of these antigens have allelic relationships: LU1/LU2, also known as Lu(a)/(b); LU6 and LU9; LU8 and LU14; and LU18/LU19, also known as Au(a)/(b) (Karamatic Crew et al., 2007). <br> Although the Au(a) antigen was found by Salmon et al. (1961), the antithetical antigen, Au(b), was not found until 1989 (Frandson et al., 1989). Daniels et al. (1991) showed that the Au(a) and Au(b) antigens belong to the Lutheran system. <br> For a discussion of Lutheran blood group phenotypes, see 247420. <br>

The Radin antigen is determined by a polymorphism in the ERMAP gene (609017.0003) and thus is a member of the blood group Scianna (Wagner et al., 2003). Radin has alternatively been labelled Sc4 to reflect this relationship. <br> Harvey et al.

It was presumed to be the result of previous transfusions. Among 1,051 English people, 4 negatives were found. Positives showed 2 grades of strength of reaction; on the assumption that the weaker reactors represented heterozygotes, an estimate of gene frequency simply by counting was possible. <br> Telen et al. (1990) found that the Yt (Cartwright) red cell antigen resided on an unidentified phosphatidylinositol (PI)-linked protein. Telen and Whitsett (1992) identified a patient with the hitherto unreported Yt(a-b-) phenotype in whom studies allowed localization of the Yt antigens to the acetylcholinesterase molecule. Telen and Whitsett (1992) found that binding of antibodies to several membrane proteins including CD55 (125240), CD58 (153420), and CD59 (107271) were normal, whereas 4 monoclonal antibodies to different acetylcholinesterase epitopes reacted only weakly with Yt(a-b-) erythrocytes. In addition, enzymatic assay of acetylcholinesterase activity of Yt(a-b-) erythrocytes demonstrated only 15% of the normal amount of enzyme activity. The use of anti-Yt(a) in radioimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated the expected 160 kD of the acetylcholinesterase molecule from normal erythrocyte membrane proteins, but not from Yt(a-b-) erythrocytes. Spring et al. (1992) obtained similar results. Thus, acetylcholinesterase is the PI-linked protein that represents the Yt antigen. <br>

112205=><br> CD79A is expressed in B lymphocytes and is part of the B-cell antigen receptor complex. This complex consists of a clonally restricted antigen-binding molecule (membrane Ig) associated noncovalently with an 'invariant' transducer/transporter complex, the CD79A/CD79B (147245) (alternatively known as Ig-alpha/Ig-beta) heterodimer; see review by Reth (1992). <br> The mouse mb1 gene was originally identified on the basis of its restricted expression in lymphocytes of B lineage. Predicted structural homology with the gamma chain of the CD3 complex of T cells (186740) led to the suggestion that the MB1 protein may associate with surface immunoglobulin on B cells and be involved in signal transduction (Ha et al., 1992). <br>
112210=><br> The MS4A1 gene encodes a member of the MS4A family of proteins that share structural similarity, amino acid sequence homology, and chromosomal location. MS4A proteins contain 4 highly conserved transmembrane domains, flanked by N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic regions. MS4A1, also known as CD20 or B1, is a human B-lymphocyte surface molecule that is widely expressed during B-cell ontogeny, from early pre-B-cell developmental stages until final differentiation into plasma cells. Functional studies using monoclonal antibodies have shown that antibody binding to B1 inhibits B-cell proliferation caused by mitogens and inhibits B-cell differentiation. Tedder et al.

The cDNAs have been used to determine the sequence of rat UCP and to monitor changes in UCP mRNA levels under various physiologic, pathologic, and pharmacologic circumstances. A controversy exists concerning the physiologic significance of brown adipose tissue in humans and its possible contribution to resistance to obesity (see 601665).

The clinical phenotype of EHK is characterized by erythema and widespread formation of epidermal blisters developing at birth. Later in life, bullous erythema is replaced by progressive hyperkeratosis, involving thickening of the cornified layer of the epidermis (summary by Muller et al., 2006). <br> Goldsmith (1976) used the designation of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis for the condition that is called bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (BCIE) when generalized, and ichthyosis hystrix (see 146600) when localized.

113900=><br> Progressive familial heart block type I (PFHBI, PFHB1) is an autosomal dominant cardiac bundle branch disorder that may progress to complete heart block (Brink and Torrington, 1977; van der Merwe et al., 1986; van der Merwe et al., 1988). It is defined on electrocardiogram by evidence of bundle branch disease, i.e., right bundle branch block, left anterior or posterior hemiblock, or complete heart block, with broad QRS complexes. Progression has been shown from a normal electrocardiogram to right bundle branch block and from the latter to complete heart block. These electrocardiographic features differentiate PFHB type I from progressive familial heart block type II (PFHBII, PFHB2; 140400), in which the onset of complete heart block is associated with narrow complexes. Electrocardiographically the changes represent, respectively, bundle branch disease (PFHB1) and atrioventricular nodal disease with an atrioventricular block and an idionodal escape rhythm (PFHB2). PFHBI is manifested symptomatically when complete heart block supervenes, either with dyspnea, syncopal episodes, or sudden death. Treatment, which is best managed by regular electrocardiographic follow-up, is by the timely implantation of a pacemaker (Brink et al., 1995). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Progressive Familial Heart Block Type I <br> Progressive familial heart block type IB (PFHB1B; 604559) is caused by mutation in the TRPM4 gene (606936) on chromosome 19q13.32. <br>

114085=><br> The response to elevation of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) levels following extra- or intracellular stimuli is mediated by proteins that are capable of binding divalent calcium ions. A particular class of these proteins is characterized by the so-called EF-hand, a helix-loop-helix motif involved in coordinating the Ca(2+) ion. Within the EF-hand superfamily, a distinct set of proteins is grouped in the so-called S-100 protein family (see S100A1; 176940 and S100B; 176990), whose members share a high degree of sequence similarity with S-100A and S-100B, Ca(2+)-binding proteins originally isolated from cerebrospinal fluid. Protein p11 (calpactin I, light chain) is a member of the S-100 family but has several unique features. It has suffered crucial deletions and amino acid substitutions which are thought to render both Ca(2+)-binding sites inactive. In all tissues and cells studied, p11 is found in a heterotetrameric complex with another Ca(2+)-binding protein, annexin II (ANX2, LIP2; 151740). Some of the biochemical properties of annexin II are modulated by p11-induced complex formation, which involves the binding of one p11 dimer to 2 annexin II monomers. The p11 calpactin I light chain is an intracellular polypeptide of 97 amino acid residues that associates with the calpactin I heavy chain, p36, to form a calcium-binding complex (Saris et al., 1987). The p11 subunit is a protein kinase substrate and likely plays a role in the regulation of p36 phosphorylation/activity. <br>

In testis, the motility of the sperm is thought to be controlled by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation and a unique form of calcineurin appears to be associated with the flagellum. The calcineurin holoenzyme is composed of catalytic and regulatory subunits of 60 and 18 kD, respectively. At least 3 genes, calcineurin A-alpha (CALNA1; 114105), calcineurin A-beta (CALNA2; 114106), and calcineurin A-gamma (CALNA3), have been cloned for the catalytic subunit.

CACNA2D1 alters the properties of pore-forming alpha-1 subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels, and it is posttranslationally processed into 2 peptides, an alpha-2 subunit and a delta subunit, that are held together by a disulfide bond. The alpha-2/delta protein is encoded by at least 4 different genes: CACNA2D1, CACNA2D2 (607082), CACNA2D3 (606399), and CACNA2D4 (608171) (Schleithoff et al., 1999; Field et al., 2006). <br>

These skeletal muscle Ca(2+) channels play a key role in excitation-contraction coupling, a process whereby electrical signals generated by action potentials at the muscle cell surface are transduced into intracellular release of calcium and ultimately muscle fiber contraction. The DHP-sensitive L-type Ca(2+) channel from skeletal muscle is an oligomeric protein composed of 2 high molecular weight polypeptide subunits (alpha-1 and alpha-2) and 3 smaller units (beta, gamma, and delta) (Campbell et al., 1988; Catterall, 1991). <br>

Both are heterodimers composed of L (large, catalytic, 80 kD) and S (small, regulatory, 30 kD) subunits.

114800=><br> Carbonic anhydrases (CAs; carbonate dehydratase; carbonate hydrolyase; EC 4.2.1.1) form a large family of genes encoding zinc metalloenzymes of great physiologic importance. As catalysts of the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide, these enzymes participate in a variety of biologic processes, including respiration, calcification, acid-base balance, bone resorption, and the formation of aqueous humor, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and gastric acid (Dodgson et al., 1991). CAs are encoded by members of 3 independent CA gene families, i.e., alpha-CA, beta-CA, and gamma-CA (Hewett-Emmett and Tashian, 1996). Genes in the alpha-carbonic anhydrase family encode either active carbonic anhydrase isozymes or 'acatalytic' (i.e., devoid of CO2 hydration activity) carbonic anhydrase-related proteins. Alpha-carbonic anhydrases show extensive diversity in tissue distribution and in their putative or established biologic functions. Some of the alpha-CAs are expressed in almost all tissues (e.g., CA II, 611492), whereas some show a more restricted expression (e.g., CA VI (114780) in salivary glands). In cells, they may reside in cytoplasm, in mitochondria, or in secretory granules, or associate with membranes. <br>

Although CA8 has a central carbonic anhydrase motif, it lacks carbonic anhydrase activity (EC 4.2.1.1) due to absence of catalytic zinc coordinating residues (Kato, 1990). Nonetheless, the gene product was designated carbonic anhydrase VIII by several workers because it showed a clear sequence identity to other members of the carbonic anhydrase gene family from many sources. <br> For background information on the CA family, see CA1 (114800). <br>

Orthopedic complications, particularly congenital dislocation of the hips and scoliosis, are common, and CCD patients are at risk of having malignant hyperthermia (MHS1; 145600).

117100=><br> Benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) or sharp waves, also known as rolandic epilepsy, is the most common idiopathic childhood epilepsy syndrome (Neubauer et al., 1998). It is termed 'rolandic' epilepsy because of the characteristic features of partial seizures involving the region around the lower portion of the central gyrus of Rolando. This results in classic focal seizures that affect the vocal tract, beginning with guttural sounds at the larynx and sensorimotor symptoms that progress to the tongue, mouth, and face, resulting in hypersalivation and speech arrest. Seizures most often occur in sleep shortly before awakening. The disorder occurs more often in boys than in girls (3:2). Rolandic epilepsy is considered a neurodevelopmental disorder, affecting 0.2% of the population. Affected individuals may have learning disabilities or behavioral problems; however, the seizures and accompanying problems usually remit during adolescence (summary by Strug et al., 2009). <br>

However, this basic tenet of biochemistry was challenged by the discovery of chaperonins, which are involved in the folding and assembly of a number of different proteins (Cheng et al., 1989; Ellis, 1990; Rothman, 1989). Members of the chaperonin family include the GroEL protein of E. coli and HSP60, a protein present in eukaryotic cell mitochondria. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, synthesis of these proteins is induced in response to stresses, such as heat shock (Venner et al., 1990). <br>
118200=><br> Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a sensorineural peripheral polyneuropathy. Affecting approximately 1 in 2,500 individuals, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is the most common inherited disorder of the peripheral nervous system (Skre, 1974). Autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked forms have been recognized. <br> - Classification <br> On the basis of electrophysiologic properties and histopathology, CMT has been divided into primary peripheral demyelinating (type 1, or HMSNI) and primary peripheral axonal (type 2, or HMSNII) neuropathies. The demyelinating neuropathies classified as CMT type 1 are characterized by severely reduced motor NCVs (less than 38 m/s) and segmental demyelination and remyelination with onion bulb formations on nerve biopsy. The axonal neuropathies classified as CMT type 2 are characterized by normal or mildly reduced NCVs and chronic axonal degeneration and regeneration on nerve biopsy (see CMT2A1; 118210). Distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) (see 158590), or spinal CMT, is characterized by exclusive motor involvement and sparing of sensory nerves (Pareyson, 1999). <br> McAlpine (1989) proposed that the forms of CMT with very slow nerve conduction be given the gene symbol CMT1A (118220) and CMT1B, CMT1A being the gene on chromosome 17 and CMT1B being the gene on chromosome 1. CMT2 was the proposed symbol for the autosomal locus responsible for the moderately slow nerve conduction form of the disease (axonal). <br> For a phenotypic description and discussion of genetic heterogeneity of the various subtypes of CMT, see CMTX1 (302800), CMT2A1 (118210), CMT3 (DSS; 145900), CMT4A (214400), and CMTDIB (606482). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Autosomal Dominant Demyelinating CMT1 <br> Autosomal dominant demyelinating CMT1 is genetically heterogeneous disorder and can be caused by mutations in different genes (see CMT1A, 118220; CMT1C, 601098; CMT1D, 607678), CMT1E (607734), and CMT1F (607734). See also 608236 for a related phenotype characterized by isolated slowed nerve conduction velocities (NCVs). <br>
118210=><br> Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease constitutes a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies. On the basis of electrophysiologic criteria, CMT is divided into 2 major types: type 1, the demyelinating form, characterized by a slow motor median nerve conduction velocity (NCV) (less than 38 m/s), and type 2, the axonal form, with a normal or slightly reduced NCV. Distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN), also known as spinal CMT, is a third type of CMT characterized by normal motor and sensory NCV and degeneration of spinal cord anterior horn cells. See CMT1B (118200) and CMT1A (118220) for descriptions of autosomal dominant slow nerve conduction types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. See CMT4A (214400) and CMTX1 (302800) for autosomal recessive and X-linked forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, respectively. <br> Several forms of axonal CMT neuropathies caused by mutations in different genes or at different loci have been described, including CMT2B (600882), CMT2B1 (605588), CMT2B2 (605589), CMT2C (606071), CMT2D (601472), CMT2E (607684), CMT2F (606595), CMT2G (608591), CMT2H (607731), CMT2I (607677), CMT2J (607736), CMT2K (607831), CMT2L (608673), CMT2M (see 606482), and CMT2N (613287). <br>

CM1 is associated with syringomyelia (see 186700) in up to 80% of cases. Although many individuals with CM1 are asymptomatic, the malformation can cause headaches, ocular disturbances, otoneurologic disturbances, lower cranial nerve signs, cerebellar ataxia, or spasticity. Onset of symptoms is usually in the third decade of life (Speer et al., 2003). <br> Since many cases of CM1 are asymptomatic, prevalence estimates may not be accurate. However, a retrospective investigation of brain MRIs reported the prevalence of CM1 to be 1 in 1,280 individuals (Meadows et al., 2000). <br>

118445=><br> The cholecystokinin (CCK) family of peptides (see 118440) and their receptors are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. The receptors can be divided into 2 subtypes on the basis of their affinity for nonsulfated analogs of CCK. Type A receptors, which have a high affinity only for sulfated CCK-8, are found principally in the gastrointestinal tract and select areas of the CNS, while type B (gastrin) receptors, having a high affinity for both sulfated and nonsulfated CCK analogs, are found principally in the CNS and select areas of the gastrointestinal tract. Highly selective, nonpeptide antagonists have been developed that support this subtype classification. In the CNS, type B receptors regulate anxiety, arousal, neuroleptic activity, and opiate-induced analgesia. Outside the CNS, they regulate gastric acid secretion and may play a role in gastrointestinal motility and growth of normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissue. The CCKB/gastrin receptor (CCKBR) can selectively be blocked by nonpeptide benzodiazepine-based antagonists. Beinborn et al. (1993) found that a single amino acid, valine-319, is critical in determining the binding affinity for these nonpeptide antagonists. They showed that it is the variability in the aliphatic side chain of the amino acid in position 319 that confers antagonist specificity and concluded that the residues underlying nonpeptide antagonist affinity must differ from those that confer against specificity. <br>

The nAChRs are (hetero)pentamers composed of homologous subunits. The subunits that make up the muscle and neuronal forms of nAChRs are encoded by separate genes and have different primary structure. There are several subtypes of neuronal nAChRs that vary based on which homologous subunits are arranged around the central channel. They are classified as alpha-subunits if, like muscle alpha-1 (100690), they have a pair of adjacent cysteines as part of the presumed acetylcholine binding site. Subunits lacking these cysteine residues are classified as beta-subunits (Groot Kormelink and Luyten, 1997). <br> Elliott et al.

118860=><br> Human chorionic gonadotropin (CG) is a glycoprotein hormone produced by trophoblastic cells of the placenta beginning 10 to 12 days after conception. Maintenance of the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy requires the production of CG, which binds to the corpus luteum of the ovary which is stimulated to produce progesterone which in turn maintains the secretory endometrium. The glycoprotein hormone family to which CG belongs includes the pituitary hormones luteinizing hormone (LH; 152780), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH; 136530), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH; 188540). Each of these hormones consists of a noncovalent dimer of alpha and beta subunits. The alpha subunit is the same for all 4 hormones (see CGA; 118850), and the beta subunits define the endocrine function of the dimer (Talmadge et al., 1983). <br>
118865=><br> Choroidal osteoma is a benign tumor found in the peripapillary region, most characteristically in one eye of otherwise healthy, young females. Histopathologic changes include bone formation with trabeculae, blood-filled cavernous spaces, and cells typical of bone formation, i.e., osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts. <br> CLINICAL DESCRIPTION {2:Noble (1990)} described a family in which <br> a girl and her monozygotic twin brothers had bilateral choroidal osteomas. The tumors showed growth between ages 11 and 13 years in the sister. The twin brothers' tumors remained stable between 9 and 11 years except for a new, isolated lesion in one eye of one of them. Their mother had a yellow mottling situated nasal to the disc in each eye resembling in appearance that in one eye in one of the twins. She showed no calcium on ultrasonography. <br> Cuhna (1984) observed an affected mother and daughter: the 33-year-old mother had visual acuity reduced to the finger counting range in each eye since age 11 years and had bilateral peripapillary atrophic chorioretinal lesions. Her 5-year-old daughter had bilateral yellow-white lesions associated with bilateral macular hemorrhages. The familial occurrence as well as the bilaterality is consistent with the origin of the osteomas in a choristoma. A choristoma is a benign tumefaction of a chorista, which is an embryonic tissue rest composed of cellular and tissue elements not normally present at the affected site. <br>

The remainder of patients have the chronic subtype, in which attacks recur for greater than 1 year without remission or with remissions lasting less than 1 month (Lipton et al., 2004). <br>

Tumstatin, a peptide fragment derived from the C-terminal noncollagenous (NC1) domain of COL4A3, has antiangiogenic activity. The NC1 domain of COL4A3 has also been referred to as the Goodpasture antigen, since it is the primary target of autoantibodies produced in Goodpasture syndrome (233450) (Bernal et al., 1993; Mariyama et al., 1994; Hamano and Kalluri, 2005). <br>

120100=><br> Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome is characterized clinically by recurrent attacks of a maculopapular rash associated with arthralgias, myalgias, fever and chills, and swelling of the extremities after exposure to cold. Despite the first description of 'cold urticaria' (Kile and Rusk, 1940) the rash in most patients is nonpruritic and nonurticarial. Rarely, some patient may also develop late-onset renal amyloidosis (Hoffman et al., 2000). <br> Muckle-Wells syndrome (191900) is an allelic disorder with overlapping clinical features, but with a higher frequency of amyloidosis and late-onset sensorineural deafness. <br> See also FCAS2 (611762), which is caused by mutation in the NLRP12 gene (609648). <br>

120110=><br> Type X is a short-chain minor collagen of cartilage (Schmid and Linsenmayer, 1985). During development and growth of long bones, chondrocytes pass sequentially through a proliferative, a hypertrophic and a degenerative stage, each characterized by a particular set of collagen types. Proliferative (stage I) chondrocytes synthesize type II collagen as the major collagen and types IX and XI as the minor collagens. Hypertrophic (stage II) chondrocytes localized in the columnar, calcifying cartilage are characterized by the synthesis of types X and II collagen. <br>
120120=><br> The COL7A1 gene encodes the alpha-1 chain of type VII collagen. Collagen VII is the main constituent of anchoring fibrils, which in the skin are located below the basal lamina at the dermal-epidermal basement membrane zone. The collagen VII molecules form disulfide bond stabilized dimeric aggregates by lateral accretion in a nonstaggered array (Burgeson et al., 1985). <br> Bentz et al. (1983) isolated the collagen VII protein from human chorioamniotic membranes and found that the amino acid composition represented a distinct type of collagen composed of 3 identical alpha chains, each with a molecular mass of about 170 kD. The authors gave this collagen the trivial name 'long-chain' (LC) collagen and suggested that it be referred to as type VII collagen. Collagen VII has a triple-helical domain almost half again longer than the type I collagen triple helix. <br>

120131=><br> Type IV collagen is found only in basement membranes, where it is the major structural component. COL4A4 is 1 of 6 alpha chains that form the heterotrimeric type IV collagen molecules (Mariyama et al., 1994). <br>
120140=>
120150=><br> Collagen has a triple-stranded rope-like coiled structure. The major collagen of skin, tendon, and bone is the same protein containing 2 alpha-1 polypeptide chains and 1 alpha-2 chain. Although these are long (the procollagen chain has a molecular mass of about 120 kD, before the 'registration peptide' is cleaved off; see 225410), each messenger RNA is monocistronic (Lazarides and Lukens, 1971). Differences in the collagens from these 3 tissues are a function of the degree of hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues, aldehyde formation for cross-linking, and glycosylation. The alpha-1 chain of the collagen of cartilage and that of the collagen of basement membrane are determined by different structural genes. The collagen of cartilage contains only 1 type of polypeptide chain, alpha-1, and this is determined by a distinct locus. The fetus contains collagen of distinctive structure. The genes for types I, II, and III collagens, the interstitial collagens, exhibit an unusual and characteristic structure of a large number of relatively small exons (54 and 108 bp) at evolutionarily conserved positions along the length of the triple helical gly-X-Y portion (Boedtker et al., 1983). The family of collagen proteins consists of a minimum of 9 types of collagen molecules whose constituent chains are encoded by a minimum of 17 genes (Ninomiya and Olsen, 1984). <br>
120160=>
120165=><br> The collagens are a large superfamily of genes that include a number of subgroups (summarized by Yoshioka et al., 1992). One such group is composed of fibrillar-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT) and includes collagen types IX (e.g., 120210), XII (e.g., 120320), XIV (e.g., 120324), and XVI (e.g., 120326). This group, of which COL19A1 is a member, has common structural features, including short stretches of collagenous domains interrupted by non-collagenous regions. These, in turn, form functional units that serve to produce adhesion to the fibrils, provide a rigid arm that projects from the fibril and provide a point of interaction with other matrix components. <br>

120180=><br> Type III collagen is a fibrillar-forming collagen comprising 3 alpha-1(III) chains and is expressed in early embryos and throughout embryogenesis. In adult, type III collagen is a major component of the extracellular matrix in a variety of internal organs and skin. Mutations in the COL3A1 gene, which encodes type III procollagen, cause type IV Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (130050), a disease leading to aortic rupture in early adult life (Liu et al., 1997). <br>

120360=><br> Type IV collagenase, 72-kD, is officially designated matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2). It is also known as gelatinase, 72-kD (Nagase et al., 1992). Type IV collagenase is a metalloproteinase that specifically cleaves type IV collagen, the major structural component of basement membranes (120090, 120130). The metastatic potential of tumor cells has been found to correlate with the activity of this enzyme. <br>
120361=><br> The 72- and 92-kD type IV collagenases are members of a group of secreted zinc metalloproteases which, in mammals, degrade the collagens of the extracellular matrix.

The 72-kD type IV collagenase (MMP2, or CLG4A; 120360) is secreted from normal skin fibroblasts, whereas the 92-kD collagenase (CLG4B) is produced by normal alveolar macrophages and granulocytes. The 92-kD type IV collagenase is also known as 92-kD gelatinase, type V collagenase, or matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9); see the glossary of matrix metalloproteinases provided by Nagase et al.

120435=><br> Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is subdivided into (1) Lynch syndrome I, or site-specific colonic cancer, and (2) Lynch syndrome II, or extracolonic cancer, particularly carcinoma of the stomach, endometrium (see 608089), biliary and pancreatic system, and urinary tract (Lynch and Lynch, 1979; Lynch et al., 1985; Mecklin and Jarvinen, 1991). HNPCC disorders show a proclivity to early onset, predominant proximal location of colon cancer, a dominant pattern of inheritance, an excess of multiple primary cancers, and significantly improved survival when compared stage for stage with the American College of Surgeons Audit Series. <br> Lynch et al. (1991) estimated that hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer accounts for about 4 to 6% of colorectal cancer. The minimum criterion of HNPCC is that colorectal carcinoma is diagnosed and histologically verified in at least 3 relatives belonging to 2 or more successive generations. Moreover, the age of onset should be less than 50 years in at least 1 patient. <br> The Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS; 158320) is a form of Lynch syndrome II associated with sebaceous skin tumors. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of HNPCC   <br> HNPCC is a genetically heterogeneous disease.

HNPCC8 (613244) results from epigenetic silencing of MSH2 caused by deletion of 3-prime exons of the EPCAM gene (185535) and intergenic regions directly upstream of the MSH2 gene. <br> Since defects in the MSH2 gene may account for as many as 60% of HNPCC cases, and defects in the MLH1 gene may play a role in up to 30%, defects in these 2 genes likely account for the vast majority of HNPCC cases. <br>

122470=><br> The Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CDLS) is a multisystem malformation syndrome recognized primarily on the basis of characteristic facial dysmorphism, including low anterior hairline, arched eyebrows, synophrys, anteverted nares, maxillary prognathism, long philtrum, thin lips, and 'carp' mouth, in association with prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, mental retardation and, in many cases, upper limb anomalies. However, there is wide clinical variability in this disorder, with milder phenotypes that may be difficult to ascertain on the basis of physical features (summary by Rohatgi et al., 2010). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Cornelia de Lange Syndrome  <br> About 50 to 60% of the cases of CDLS are due to mutation in the NIPBL gene (Musio et al., 2006; Rohatgi et al., 2010). <br> An X-linked form of the disorder (CDLS2; 300590) can be caused by mutation in the SMC1A gene (300040), which accounts for about 5% of cases. A mild variant of Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CDLS3; 610759) has been related to mutation in the SMC3 gene (606062). All 3 genes, NIPBL, SMC1A, and SMC3, encode components of the cohesin complex. <br>

Acquired prion diseases include iatrogenic CJD, kuru (245300), variant CJD (vCJD) in humans, scrapie in sheep, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle. Variant CJD is believed to be acquired from cattle infected with BSE.

Each domain folds into 2 similar 'Greek key' motifs, with distinctive beta-sheet folding. Different beta-crystallin proteins can interact with each other to form oligomers of different sizes ranging from dimers to octamers and can also interact with other lens proteins.

124030=><br> The hepatic cytochrome P450 system is responsible for the first phase in the metabolism and elimination of numerous endogenous and exogenous molecules and ingested chemicals. P450 enzymes convert these substances into electrophilic intermediates which are then conjugated by phase II enzymes (e.g., UDP glucuronosyltransferases, see 191740; N-acetyltransferases, see 108345) to hydrophilic derivatives that can be excreted (Nebert, 1997). <br> The P450II superfamily comprises at least 11 subfamilies designated by letter according to the system of nomenclature recommended by an international committee (Nelson et al., 1996; Nebert et al., 1987; Nelson et al., 2004). Although humans probably have approximately 60 unique P450 genes within 14 subfamilies (Nelson et al., 1996), only a subset are responsible for metabolism of the vast majority of prescribed and over-the-counter drugs (see, e.g., CYP1A2, 124060; CYP2A6, 122720; CYP2C19, 124020; CYP2D6; CYP2E1, 124040; CYP3A4, 124010; and CYP4A11, 601310). <br>

124200=><br> Darier-White disease, also known as keratosis follicularis, is an autosomal dominant skin disorder characterized by warty papules and plaques in seborrheic areas (central trunk, flexures, scalp, and forehead), palmoplantar pits, and distinctive nail abnormalities (Sakuntabhai et al., 1999). The prevalence of the disease had been estimated at 1 in 55,000. Onset is usually before the third decade, and penetrance is complete in adults, although expressivity is variable. Involvement may be severe, with widespread itchy malodorous crusted plaques, painful erosions, blistering, and mucosal lesions. Secondary infection is common. Sun, heat, and sweating exacerbate the disease. Darier disease never remits, but oral retinoids may reduce hyperkeratosis. Neuropsychiatric abnormalities, including mild mental retardation and epilepsy, have been described in association with Darier disease in a few families (Burge and Wilkinson, 1992); whether this is an association based on pleiotropism of the mutant gene or reflects coincidence is not clear. Histologic findings are (1) mild nonspecific perivascular infiltration in the dermis; (2) dermal villi protruding into the epidermis; (3) suprabasal detachment of the spinal layer leading to the formation of lacunae containing acantholytic cells; (4) in the more superficial epidermis, dyskeratotic round epidermal cells ('corps ronds'), the most distinctive feature; and (5) in the stratum corneum, 'grains' that resemble parakeratotic cells embedded in a hyperkeratotic horny layer. Electron microscopy reveals loss of desmosomal attachments, perinuclear aggregations of keratin filaments, and cytoplasmic vacuolization. Ultrastructural and immunologic studies suggest the disease results from an abnormality in the desmosome-keratin filament complex leading to a breakdown in cell adhesion. <br>

The physiologic role of DAF is to inhibit the complement cascade at the level of the critical C3 (120700) convertase step. By this mechanism, DAF protects autologous cells and tissues from complement-mediated damage and thereby plays a role in preventing or modulating autoimmune disease and inflammation. DAF also serves as a receptor for certain strains of E. coli and certain types of enteroviruses. Variation in DAF forms the basis of the Cromer blood group system (CROM; 613793) (review by Lublin, 2005).

125643=><br> The desmosome is a complex adhesive structure that plays a fundamental role in maintaining the strength and integrity of epithelial tissues. Central to this role are transmembrane glycoproteins that mediate cell-cell adhesion at the extracellular surface and interact with the cytoskeleton (via components of the desmosomal plaque), thus linking the intermediate filament networks of adjacent cells. Desmosomal glycoproteins comprise 2 distinct groups, the desmogleins and the desmocollins, both of which are members of the cadherin superfamily of Ca(2+)-dependent cell adhesion molecules (summary by King et al., 1993). <br>

125647=><br> Desmosomes are the most common type of intercellular junction in vertebrate epithelial cells. They are characterized by 2 forms of interaction with other cellular structures. First, they form membrane anchorage sites for intermediate-size filaments, which are seen as electron-dense plaques evident beneath the plasma membrane. Second, a specific membrane core domain interacts with a corresponding domain of the plasma membrane of an adjacent cell, apparently mediating intercellular adhesion in a stable way. The desmosome intermediate filament complex is thought to impart tensile strength and resilience to the epithelium. Desmosomal proteins can be divided into 2 groups based on whether they fractionate with the urea-insoluble 'core' or the urea-soluble 'plaque' components. Desmoglein (125670) is, for example, a protein of the core. The main proteins of the plaque comprise the desmoplakins and plakoglobin (173325). <br>

125950=><br> Benzodiazepines modulate signal transduction at type A GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors (137160) located in brain synapses (summarized by Gray et al., 1986). GABA is the predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter of the mammalian central nervous system. This receptor binds GABA, beta-carbolines, and benzodiazepines with high affinity and a chloride ion channel. Benzodiazepines prolong the chloride ion channel opening burst elicited by GABA and thereby enhance GABA-mediated inhibitory responses. This facilitation plays a role in reducing pathologic anxiety. An endogenous ligand has been identified that is recognized by the beta-carboline/benzodiazepine recognition site located in the GABA receptor. This ligand, diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), is a protein of about 11 kD that displaces beta-carbolines and benzodiazepines bound to brain membrane fractions in vitro. DBI or a derivative small neuropeptide is thought to downregulate the effects of GABA. <br>

DHFR is inhibited by methotrexate (MTX), a folate analog used as an antineoplastic and immunosuppressive agent. In addition to the functional DHFR gene, there are at least 4 intronless genes that are probably pseudogenes. Each of the 5 is on a separate chromosome.

The hypocalcification type is the most frequent type of enamel dysplasia, occurring in about 1 in 20,000 individuals (Witkop and Sauk, 1976). Large masses of supragingival calculus become deposited on the teeth, and this is frequently associated with severe gingivitis or periodontitis (Winter and Brook, 1975). <br>

131100=><br> Multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by varying combinations of tumors of parathyroids, pancreatic islets, duodenal endocrine cells, and the anterior pituitary, with 94% penetrance by age 50. Less commonly associated tumors include foregut carcinoids, lipomas, angiofibromas, thyroid adenomas, adrenocortical adenomas, angiomyolipomas, and spinal cord ependymomas. Except for gastrinomas, most of the tumors are nonmetastasizing, but many can create striking clinical effects because of the secretion of endocrine substances such as gastrin, insulin, parathyroid hormone, prolactin, growth hormone, glucagon, or adrenocorticotropic hormone (summary by Chandrasekharappa et al., 1997). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia <br> Other forms of multiple endocrine neoplasia include MEN2A (171400) and MEN2B (162300), both of which are caused by mutation in the RET gene (164761), and MEN4 (610755), which is caused by mutation in the CDKN1B gene (600778). <br>

It is thought to be responsible for the accumulation of blood leukocytes at sites of inflammation by mediating the adhesion of cells to the vascular lining. It exhibits structural features homologous to those of LYAM1 (153240), including the presence of lectin- and EGF-like domains followed by short consensus repeat (SCR) domains that contain 6 conserved cysteine residues.

The protein product was originally identified as platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PDECGF), an angiogenic factor distinct from the previously described endothelial cell mitogens of the fibroblast growth factor family (Ishikawa et al., 1989). PDECGF is stored in platelets as a 45-kD single polypeptide chain and has a highly restricted target cell specificity acting only on endothelial cells. It promotes angiogenesis in vivo, and stimulates the in vitro growth of a variety of endothelial cells. <br>

Microscopic examination of the skin shows cleavage below the basement membrane within the papillary dermis. All forms are caused by mutation in the COL7A1 gene. Fine et al. (2000) proposed that the Cockayne-Touraine and Pasini subtypes of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa be combined into 1 category known as 'dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa' (DDEB), since both are caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene and show overlapping clinical features. <br> Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (see, e.g., 131800) and epidermolysis bullosa junctional (see, e.g., 226700) are clinically and genetically distinct disorders characterized by tissue separation at the levels of the basal keratinocyte layer and lamina lucida, respectively. <br>

The other 2 main types of EBS include the milder generalized Koebner type (131900) and the milder and localized Weber-Cockayne type (131800) (Fine et al., 2008).

The condition in which bullae were limited to the hands and feet was referred to as the Cockayne type of epidermolysis bullosa (131800). <br> On the basis of an extensive study in Norway and review of the literature, Gedde-Dahl (1971) arrived at a classification of epidermolysis bullosa. EB simplex in this classification encompassed disorders characterized by bulla formation within the epidermis, basal cell vacuolization, and dissolution of tonofibrils on electron microscopy. The generalized Koebner form and the localized Weber-Cockayne type were believed to be allelic. Gedde-Dahl (1981) recognized at least 16 varieties of epidermolysis bullosa and suggested that dominant EB simplex can be clinically and genetically divided into at least 4 types: the generalized Koebner type, the localized Weber-Cockayne type, the mild Ogna type with fragile skin (131950), and a form with mottled pigmentation (131960). <br> Fine et al.

Patients with BSS develop multiple skin appendage tumors including cylindromas, trichoepitheliomas, and spiradenomas. Patients with familial cylindromatosis have only cylindromas, and those with MFT1 have only trichoepitheliomas. However, because these disorders show overlapping phenotypic features, and because different manifestations of each have been described within a single family, many consider these disorders to represent a phenotypic spectrum of a single disease entity (Guggenheim and Schnyder, 1961; Welch et al., 1968; Gerretsen et al., 1995; Lee et al., 2005; Bowen et al., 2005; Young et al., 2006; Saggar et al., 2008). <br> Van Balkom and Hennekam (1994), who preferred the designation 'dermal eccrine cylindromatosis' for familial cylindromatosis, provided a review.

Relief is obtained with cold (Michiels et al., 2005). The severity of the disorder may progress with age, and symptoms may extend over a larger body area, such as over the ankles and lower legs, and become constant (Mandell et al., 1977). <br> Waxman and Dib-Hajj (2005) provided a review of primary erythermalgia. <br> Although 'primary' or 'familial erythromelalgia' are sometimes used as alternative terms for primary erythermalgia (Waxman and Dib-Hajj, 2005), secondary erythromelalgia is a distinct acquired disorder associated with thrombocythemia or myeloproliferative disorders. It has relatively late onset and symptoms are caused by platelet aggregation in end-arteriolar circulation, leading to ischemia and symptoms (Michiels and van Joost, 1990). Treatment with aspirin, which irreversibly inhibits platelet cyclooxygenase activity, affords relief from acquired erythromelalgia (Michiels et al., 1984; Drenth et al., 1996). Similarly, acquired erythromelalgia vanishes with lowering the platelet count to normal with chemotherapy (Michiels et al., 1985). <br> van Genderen et al. (1993) emphasized the distinction between hereditary erythermalgia and acquired erythromelalgia. In primary erythermalgia, the burning pain, redness, and warmth of feet and lower legs, with relative sparing of the toes, are easily provoked by warmth and exercise. In contrast, in acquired erythromelalgia the burning pain and red congestion preferentially involves one or more toes or fingers or sole of the forefoot (Michiels and van Joost, 1990). Van Genderen et al. (1993) noted that 3 of the 5 patients reported by Smith and Allen (1938) were not consistent with the diagnosis of primary erythromelalgia because the symptoms were relieved promptly by aspirin, consistent with acquired erythromelalgia. <br>

Hematologic characteristics include particularly ineffective and hyperplastic erythropoiesis with megaloblastic components accompanied by myeloblastic proliferation of varying degree (Park et al., 2002). <br> Park et al. (2002) discussed the evolution of the definition of 'erythroleukemia,' which is considered by most to be a subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; 601626). Controversy about the precise definition of erythroleukemia revolves around the number or percentage of erythroblasts and myeloblasts found in the bone marrow and peripheral circulation. In the French-American-British (FAB) classification system (Bennett et al., 1985), it is known as AML-M6, whereas in the revised World Health Organization (WHO) classification system (Harris et al., 1999), it is known as 'AML, not otherwise categorized' (Zini and D'Onofrio, 2004). <br>

133239=><br> Esophageal cancer, particularly esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Both environmental and genetic risk factors play a role in the pathogenesis of the disorder. In Europe and North America, heavy smoking, alcohol consumption, and increased body mass index (BMI) are the main environmental risk factors. In contrast, the particularly high incidence of ESCC in some areas of China, central Asia, and southern Africa is associated with nutritional deficiencies, high intake of nitrosamine-rich or pickled vegetables, and low socioeconomic status; smoking, alcohol consumption, and BMI play a lesser role in these populations. There is a tendency for familial aggregation of ESCC in high-risk geographic areas, suggesting a genetic component to increased susceptibility. Gastric cardia adenocarcinoma is another common type of cancer in China that shows similarities to ESCC in terms of geographic distribution and environmental risk factors (summary by Wang et al., 2010 and Abnet et al., 2010). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Somatic Mutations in Esophageal Cancer <br> Somatic mutations in several different genes have been found in esophageal cancer tissue.

EIF4E is a eukaryotic translation initiation factor involved in directing ribosomes to the cap structure of mRNAs. It is a 24-kD polypeptide that exists as both a free form and as part of a multiprotein complex termed EIF4F. The EIF4E polypeptide is the rate-limiting component of the eukaryotic translation apparatus and is involved in the mRNA-ribosome binding step of eukaryotic protein synthesis. The other subunits of EIF4F are a 50-kD polypeptide, termed EIF4A (see 601102), that possesses ATPase and RNA helicase activities, and a 220-kD polypeptide, EIF4G (600495) (Rychlik et al., 1987). <br>

In humans, XPG endonuclease (133530) makes the 3-prime incision relative to the lesion.

Deformity of the legs, forearms (resembling Madelung deformity), and hands is frequent (Peterson, 1989). <br> Two conditions in which multiple exostoses occur are metachondromatosis (156250) and the Langer-Giedion syndrome (LGS; 150230); the latter condition is also known as trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type II. Furthermore, exostosis-like lesions occur with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP; 135100), occipital horn syndrome (304150), and the adult stage of hereditary hypophosphatemia (see 307800); these exostoses are located at sites of tendon and muscle attachment. A relatively rare variant of the supracondylar process, on the anteromedial surface of the distal humerus, can be confused with an exostosis; the variant is said to be present in about 1% of persons of European descent (Silverman, 1985). <br>

Its clinical appearance varies considerably, even within families, with severely affected patients often registered as blind during infancy, whereas mildly affected patients with few or no visual problems may have such a small area of avascularity in their peripheral retina that it is visible only by fluorescein angiography. It is believed that this peripheral avascularity is the primary anomaly in FEVR and results from defective retinal angiogenesis. The sight-threatening features of the FEVR phenotype are considered secondary to retinal avascularity and develop because of the resulting retinal ischemia; they include the development of hyperpermeable blood vessels, neovascularisation, vitreoretinal traction, retinal folds, and retinal detachments (summary by Poulter et al., 2010). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy <br> An X-linked form of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (EVR2; 305390) is caused by mutation in the NDP gene (300658); EVR3 (605750) maps to chromosome 11p13-p12; EVR4 (601813) can be caused by heterozygous or homozygous mutations in the LRP5 gene (603506) on 11q13.4; and EVR5 (613310) is caused by heterozygous mutations in the TSPAN12 gene (613138) on 7q31. <br>

Once formed, the tissue factor/factor VII complex converts to a complex of tissue factor and enzymatically active factor VII (F7a); this conversion leads to activation of factors X (F10; 613872) and IX (300746) and prothrombin (176930), and ultimately to formation of fibrin (134570/134580). These processes are regulated by plasma protease inhibitors and by the thrombomodulin (188040)-protein C (612283) pathway. A further regulatory mechanism in the extrinsic pathway is called tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI; 152310). For a review, see Davie et al. (1991). <br>

Membrane-bound and soluble forms of a high-affinity folate binding protein have been found in kidney, placenta, serum, milk, and in several cell lines. The 2 forms have similar binding characteristics for folates, are immunologically cross-reactive, and, based upon limited amino acid sequence data, are nearly identical. There may be a precursor-product relationship between the membrane and soluble forms, the membrane form having additional amino acid residues and greater molecular weight. The membrane form has been shown to mediate the transport of folate in cells grown in physiologic concentrations of folate (Lacey et al., 1989).

The prevalence of FECD has been estimated at about 5% among persons over the age of 40 years in the United States. The vision loss in patients with FECD results from a loss of corneal transparency associated with irregularity of inner corneal layers in early disease and edema of the cornea in advanced disease. Ultrastructural features of FECD include loss and attenuation of endothelial cells, with thickening and excrescences of the underlying basement membrane. These excrescences, called guttae, are the clinical hallmark of FECD and become more numerous with progression of the disease. As the endothelial layer develops confluent guttae in the central cornea, the cells are no longer able to keep the cornea dehydrated and clear (summary by Baratz et al., 2010). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy <br> More common, late-onset forms of FECD have been shown to be caused by mutation in the SLC4A11 gene (610206) on chromosome 20p13-p12 (FECD4; 613268) and the ZEB1 gene (189909) on chromosome 10p11.2 (FECD6; 613270). <br> Other loci for late-onset FECD have been identified on chromosomes 13pter-q12.13 (FECD2; 610158), 18q21.2-q21.32 (FECD3; 613267), 5q33.1-q35.2 (FECD5; 613269), and 9p (FECD7; 613271). <br>

It catalyzes the conversion of fumarate to malate. <br> - Enzyme Structure <br> Fumarase exists in both cytosolic and mitochondrial forms, which differ in electrophoretic mobility. Kinsella and Doonan (1986) found an unusually high degree of identity of structure of human fumarase and that from B. subtilis and E. coli. Using peptide mapping, O'Hare and Doonan (1985) showed that the cytosolic and mitochondrial fumarases from pig liver are identical over nearly all of their amino acid sequences, but that they differ at their N-termini. <br> - Isoenzymes <br> Edwards and Hopkinson (1979) studied a family with an electrophoretic variant of FH. Two persons had variation in both the soluble and the mitochondrial forms, suggesting that they are determined by a single locus. Posttranslational processing may account for the differences between the 2 forms. Another possibility is that the 2 enzymes are heteromeric and share a subunit coded by chromosome 1. If posttranslational processing is the mechanism, all control of processing (e.g., enzymes) seems to be coded by chromosome 1. Common genetic control of both soluble and mitochondrial fumarate hydratase is further supported by the finding of combined deficiency. Doonan et al. (1984) cited evidence suggesting that the isoenzymes of fumarase are translated in precursor form from 2 different mRNA molecules, these mRNAs in turn arising from alternative splicing of a single gene transcript. <br>

Heterozygous CDH1 mutation carriers have a 70 to 80% lifetime risk of developing diffuse gastric cancer. In addition to gastric cancer, up to 60% of female mutation carriers develop lobular carcinoma of the breast, and some carriers may develop colorectal cancer. Identification of mutation carriers is important, because the characteristic microscopic foci of signet ring cell adenocarcinoma in HDGC usually involves the submucosa and is often not readily detectable by routine upper endoscopy screening (summary by Fitzgerald et al., 2009). <br> HDGC is considered to be a distinct disease entity from the more common sporadic occurrence of gastric cancer (613659), which can be associated with environmental factors, such as Helicobacter pylori infection, high-fat diet, or smoking, and is often associated with somatic mutations in disease tissue. <br>

Its sequence indicates that it is a member of a family of structurally related hormones that includes secretin (182099), glucagon (138030), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP; 192320), and growth hormone-releasing factor (GHRH; 139190) (summary by Takeda et al., 1987). <br>
137241=><br> Gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP; 137240), also called glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, is a 42-amino acid polypeptide synthesized by K cells of the duodenum and small intestine. It was originally identified as an activity in gut extracts that inhibited gastric acid secretion and gastrin release, but subsequently was demonstrated to stimulate insulin release potently in the presence of elevated glucose. The insulinotropic effect on pancreatic islet beta-cells was then recognized to be the principal physiologic action of GIP. Together with glucagon-like peptide-1, GIP is largely responsible for the secretion of insulin after eating. It is involved in several other facets of the anabolic response. <br>

137250=><br> The 17- and 34-residue amidated gastrin peptides (G17 and G34, respectively) are processed from a common preprogastrin and are major gastrointestinal hormones that regulate gastric acid secretion, gastric motility, and growth of the gastrointestinal mucosa. In addition, progastrin and intermediate peptides in gastrin biosynthesis have their own biologic activities (Kariya et al., 1986, Bishop et al., 1998). <br>
137260=><br> Gastrin-releasing polypeptide is the mammalian equivalent of the amphibian tetradecapeptide bombesin. In nanogram amounts, both GRP and bombesin infused into humans increase plasma gastrin (137250), pancreatic polypeptide (167780), glucagon (138030), gastric inhibitory peptide, and insulin (176730). Bombesin is also a potent neuroregulator. Bombesin-like immunoreactivity has a high level in neuroendocrine cells of the lung. High levels are found in the human lung just after birth and levels decrease thereafter in parallel with the observed disease in number of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells.

GATA2 is expressed in hematopoietic progenitors, including early erythroid cells, mast cells, and megakaryocytes, and also in nonhematopoietic embryonic stem cells. In chicken erythroid progenitors, forced expression of GATA2 promotes proliferation at the expense of differentiation (Briegel et al., 1993). GATA3 (131320) expression is restricted to T-lymphoid cells and some nonhematopoietic cell types, including embryonic stem cells. <br>

Gerstmann-Straussler disease typically presents with progressive limb and truncal ataxia, dysarthria, and cognitive decline in the thirties and forties, and the average disease duration is 7 years. GSS can be distinguished from CJD by earlier age at onset, longer disease duration, and prominent cerebellar ataxia (Masters et al., 1981). <br> On the basis of clinical and pathologic criteria, Hsiao et al. (1989) suggested that Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome could be classified into 3 forms: an 'ataxic' form, a 'dementing' form, and a dementing form that is accompanied by pathologic quantities of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). However, these distinctions may only underscore the phenotypic variability in presentation and progression of the disease (Panegyres et al., 2001). <br>

137580=><br> Tourette syndrome is a neurobehavioral disorder manifest particularly by motor and vocal tics and associated with behavioral abnormalities. Tics are sudden, brief, intermittent, involuntary or semi-voluntary movements (motor tics) or sounds (phonic or vocal tics). They typically consist of simple, coordinated, repetitive movements, gestures, or utterances that mimic fragments of normal behavior. Motor tics may range from simple blinking, nose twitching, and head jerking to more complex throwing, hitting, or making rude gestures. Phonic tics include sniffling, throat clearing, blowing, coughing, echolalia, or coprolalia. Males are affected about 3 times more often than females, and onset usually occurs between 3 and 8 years of age. By age 18 years, more than half of affected individuals are free of tics, but they may persist into adulthood (review by Jankovic, 2001). <br>

138130=><br> L-glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.3) has a central role in nitrogen metabolism in plants and animals. Glutamate dehydrogenase is found in all organisms and catalyzes the oxidative deamination of 1-glutamate to 2-oxoglutarate (Smith et al., 2001). Glutamate, the main substrate of GLUD, is present in brain in concentrations higher than in other organs.

138252=><br> The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channel has been shown to be involved in long-term potentiation, an activity-dependent increase in the efficiency of synaptic transmission thought to underlie certain kinds of memory and learning. Functional NMDA receptors appear to be composed (minimally) of an invariant subunit (NMDAR1; 138249) and 1 of several variable subunits (see GRIN2D; 602717). Each of the variable subunits exhibits a distinct distribution in the adult brain. For example, postnatally, NMDA receptors containing the NMDAR2B subunit are primarily localized to the hippocampus and forebrain. <br>
138253=><br> Molecular cloning and expression of cDNAs demonstrate that the epsilon and zeta subfamilies of the mouse glutamate receptor channel subunits constitute NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor channels (see GRIN2D; 602717). Four members of the epsilon subfamily, the E1, E2 (GRIN2B; 138252), E3 (GRIN2C; 138254), and E4 (GRIN2D) subunits, are distinct in distribution, functional properties, and regulation. Thus, the molecular diversity of the epsilon subunit family probably underlies the functional heterogeneity of the NMDA receptor channel. Rat counterparts of the mouse E1, E2, E3, E4, and zeta-1 (Z1; GRIN1, 138249) subunits were also isolated and designated as Nr2a, Nr2b, Nr2c, Nr2d, and Nmdar1, respectively (Monyer et al., 1992; Ishii et al., 1993). <br>

Significance of the enzyme derives from its possible implication in behavior disturbances in which glutamate acts as a neurotransmitter (Prusiner, 1981). High heritability of platelet glutaminase was indicated by studies of Sahai and Vogel (1983) who found an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.96 for monozygotic twins and 0.53 for dizygotic twins. <br>

Fetal glutamine requirements are very high and depend largely on active glutamine synthesis and the release of glutamine into the fetal circulation by the placenta. Glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.2), also called glutamate-ammonia ligase (GLUL), is expressed throughout the body and plays an important role in controlling body pH and in removing ammonia from the circulation.

The 3 enzyme activities are encoded in a linear, nonoverlapping fashion on the GARS-AIRS-GART mRNA. Starting at the 5-prime end of the cDNA, the 3 enzyme activities are glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase (GARS, EC 6.3.4.13), aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase (AIRS, EC 6.3.3.1), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GART, EC 2.1.2.2).

139340=><br> In photoreceptors, light-activated photopigment (see, e.g., red cone pigment, 300822) interacts with transducin, a 3-subunit G protein, stimulating the exchange of bound GDP for GTP (Morris and Fong, 1993). The transducin alpha-subunit, bound to GTP, is then released from its beta/gamma-subunits and activates cGMP-phosphodiesterase by removing the inhibitory gamma-subunits therefrom. The cGMP-PDE lowers the concentration of cGMP, causing the closure of cGMP-dependent cation channels and hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor. The transducin alpha-subunits are different in rods and cones, being encoded by different genes, GNAT1 (139330) in rods and GNAT2 in cones. <br>

141749=><br> Classic hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) is characterized by a substantial elevation of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in adult red blood cells. There are no other phenotypic or hematologic manifestations. Expression of the HBG1 and HBG2 genes, which encode the gamma isoforms of HbF, is normally suppressed shortly before birth and replaced by expression of the beta- (HBB; 141900) or delta- (HBD; 142000) chains, which form adult hemoglobin. Adults normally have less than 1% HbF, whereas heterozygotes for HPFH have 5 to 30% HbF. HPFH heterozygotes have essentially normal red cell indices and a rather homogeneous distribution of HbF among red cells, termed 'pancellular.' Homozygotes for HPFH can express HbF in up to 100% of red blood cells (Thein and Craig, 1998). <br> Delta-beta thalassemia is a hemoglobin disorder characterized by decreased or absent synthesis of the delta- and beta-globin chains with a compensatory increase in expression of fetal gamma-chain synthesis from the affected chromosome. Individuals with delta-beta thalassemia have hypochromic, microcytic anemia and increased HbF, which may mitigate the anemia depending on the level of HbF. Delta-beta thalassemia and some forms of HPFH result from deletions within the beta-globin gene cluster on chromosome 11p15; this has been referred to as 'deletional' HPFH. HPFH can also result from point mutations in the promoter regions of the gamma globulin genes HBG1 and HBG2; this has been referred to as 'non-deletional' HPFH (Ottolenghi et al., 1982; Forget, 1998). <br> Forget (1998) noted that HPFH and delta-beta thalassemia are not clearly distinct disorders, but rather show partially overlapping features that may defy classification. Higher expression of HbF is often termed 'pancellular,' whereas lower expression of HbF is often termed 'heterocellular,' although these represent a spectrum. <br> Approximately 10% of the population has HPFH manifest as modest elevations of HbF (1 to 4%) present in a subset of red cells (about 4.5%) termed F cells. This is also sometimes referred to as 'heterocellular' HPFH, and is considered to be a multifactorial trait influenced by multiple genetic loci (Thein and Craig, 1998). <br>

Ten to fifteen percent of adults fall within the upper tail of the distribution and have HbF levels between 0.8% and 5%, a condition referred to as heterocellular hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin Although these HbF levels are modest in otherwise healthy individuals, interaction of heterocellular HPFH with beta-thalassemia (see 613985) or sickle cell disease (SS; 603903) can increase HbF output in these individuals to levels that are clinically beneficial (Menzel et al., 2007). <br> For a general phenotypic description and a discussion of loci that may affect fetal hemoglobin levels, see HBFQTL1 (141749). <br>

Prevalence in newborns ranges from 1 in 2,500 to 1 in 4,000, and there is a 30 to 60% mortality rate (Langham et al., 1996; Harrison et al., 1994; Nobuhara et al., 1996). Most cases of congenital diaphragmatic hernia are sporadic. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Diaphragmatic Hernia <br> One form of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, DIH1, has been mapped to chromosome 15q26, and another, DIH2 (222400), to chromosome 8p23.1.

Each year more than half a million die as a result of acute or chronic HBV infection. Vaccination has been highly successful at preventing new HBV infections and has been implemented into the national immunization programs of more than 150 countries. However, the immune response to HBV vaccination varies greatly among individuals, with 5 to 10% of healthy adults failing to produce protective levels of antibodies. Several factors have been implicated in determining the response to HBV vaccination, including physical factors, such as age, gender, obesity, immunosuppression, and smoking, as well as variation in genes of the immune system (summary by Davila et al., 2010). <br>

Patients are diagnosed with the short-segment form (S-HSCR, approximately 80% of cases) when the aganglionic segment does not extend beyond the upper sigmoid, and with the long-segment form (L-HSCR) when aganglionosis extends proximal to the sigmoid (Amiel et al., 2008). Total colonic aganglionosis and total intestinal HSCR also occur. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Hirschsprung Disease <br> Several additional loci for isolated Hirschsprung disease have been mapped. HSCR2 (600155) is associated with variation in the EDNRB gene (131244) on 13q22; HSCR3 (613711) is associated with variation in the GDNF gene (600837) on 5p13.1-p12; HSCR4 (613712) is associated with variation in the EDN3 gene (131242) on 20q13; HSCR5 (600156) maps to 9q31; HSCR6 (606874) maps to 3p21; HSCR7 (606875) maps to 19q12; HSCR8 (608462) maps to 16q23; and HSCR9 (611644) maps to 4q31-q32. <br> HSCR also occurs as a feature of several syndromes including the Waardenburg-Shah syndrome (277580), Mowat-Wilson syndrome (235730), Goldberg-Shpritzen megacolon syndrome (609460), and congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS; 209880). <br> Whereas mendelian modes of inheritance have been described for syndromic HSCR, isolated HSCR stands as a model for genetic disorders with complex patterns of inheritance. Isolated HSCR appears to be of complex nonmendelian inheritance with low sex-dependent penetrance and variable expression according to the length of the aganglionic segment, suggestive of the involvement of one or more genes with low penetrance. The development of surgical procedures decreased mortality and morbidity, which allowed the emergence of familial cases (Amiel et al., 2008). HSCR occurs as an isolated trait in 70% of patients, is associated with chromosomal anomaly in 12% of cases, and occurs with additional congenital anomalies in 18% of cases. <br>

The MHC encodes highly polymorphic proteins, many of which are associated with the immune system. The products of classical polymorphic class I genes, human leukocyte antigen-A (HLA-A), HLA-B (142830), and HLA-C (142840), interact with T-cell receptor (TCR; see 186880) molecules, as well as killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs; see 604936) expressed on natural killer cells and some T cells (review by Trowsdale, 2001). <br> Evidence from amino acid sequences suggests an evolutionary relatedness of transplantation antigens, immunoglobulins and beta-2-microglobins (Tragardh et al., 1979). Both the class I MHC antigens (A, B, and C) and the class II antigens DR and DC1 are polymorphic 2-chain cell surface glycoproteins; they are recognized by different subsets of T cells and have different functions, tissue distributions, and structures. The light chain of class I antigens is beta-2-microglobulin (B2M; 109700), which is coded by chromosome 15. The heavy chain, coded by chromosome 6, has a molecular mass of 44,000 and is made up of 3 N-terminal extracellular domains of 90 amino acids each, a small hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment and a small hydrophilic intracellular C-terminal domain. The 2 N-terminal domains are polymorphic, bear the carbohydrate and have no sequence homology with immunoglobulin. The third domain, closest to the membrane, and the 11.6-kD B2M light chain are highly conserved and have strong sequence homology with immunoglobulin. <br>

Because the HLA class II molecules are highly polymorphic, they can embrace a wide variety of antigens in their antigen-binding groove and present them to diverse T-lymphocyte antigen receptors, triggering antigen recognition. Amino acids located at key positions along the alpha-helical portions of these HLA heterodimers dictate which peptide antigens can bind. Even single amino acid substitutions in these regions may alter the shape of HLA-peptide binding pocket sufficiently to change its specificity. <br>
142860=><br> Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules present antigens to CD4 (186940)-positive cells. Human class II MHC molecules are of 3 major isotypes, HLA-DR, HLA-DP (see 142880), and HLA-DQ (see 146880), each of which consists of an alpha and a beta chain. Both the alpha and beta chains of HLA-DP and HLA-DQ are polymorphic, whereas HLA-DR alpha (HLA-DRA) is invariant and HLA-DR beta (HLA-DRB; see 142857) is polymorphic. Thus, differences in the HLA-DR beta chain account for different peptide-binding motifs of HLA-DR molecules (Dai et al., 2008). <br> Lee et al. (1982) described 2 cDNA clones containing sequences corresponding to HLA-DR antigens, specifically the 34,000 MW glycoprotein chain. The authors stated that the heavy chain is largely invariant and that the light chain (MW about 28,000) carries the major polymorphic determinants. Other HLA-D/DR-associated antigens with different heavy and light chains (also called alpha and beta, respectively) have been identified on B cells (Accolla et al., 1981; Shackelford et al., 1981). <br> Korman et al. (1982) provided information on the primary structure of the heavy and light chains of DR. The HLA-DR antigen heterodimer consists of 4 extracellular domains, 2 of which are Ig-like (1 in the heavy chain, alpha-2, and 1 in the light chain, beta-2). The third is the amino-terminal polymorphic domain of the light chain (beta-1), and the fourth is an invariant domain in the heavy chain (alpha-1). Both the light and the heavy chains have a large glycosylated amino-terminal extracellular region, a small hydrophobic membranous region, and a small hydrophilic carboxy-terminal region; in this they resemble class I MHC antigens. Kaufman and Strominger (1982) applied limited proteolysis to demonstrate further that the extracellular region of the light chain consists of 2 domains, each with a disulfide loop. The amino-terminal domain bears the carbohydrate and is polymorphic, while the carboxy-terminal domain is relatively conserved and has significant amino acid homology with immunoglobulins. In DR, it is the light chain that is polymorphic; in class I antigens, beta-2-microglobulin is invariant or highly conserved. Larhammar et al. (1982) likewise commented on similarities to both the immunoglobulins and the class I MHC antigens. They referred to the 2 chains of the class II molecules as alpha and beta. They provided the complete nucleotide sequence of a beta-chain gene and deduced the corresponding amino acid sequence. Kratzin et al. (1981) published the sequence of another beta chain which shows about 70% homology with the one reported by Larhammar et al. (1982). This is consistent with the conclusion that the HLA-D region contains at least 2 (Accolla et al., 1981) and probably more (Shackelford et al., 1981) genes for class II antigens. <br> The DR, DP (146880), and DQ (142880) gene products resemble each other fairly closely and also resemble Ia of the mouse. They are heterodimers of 1 alpha, or heavy, chain (MW 33,000) and 1 beta, or light, chain (MW 28,000). The serologic specificity resides mainly in the beta chain (Erlich et al., 1983). <br> Walker et al. (1983) determined the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the alpha and beta chains of HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR2 antigens. No differences were found in the alpha chains. However, in the first 35 N-terminal residues of the beta chains, 2 regions of variability were apparent, each comprising about 6 amino acids. The authors suggested that these variable regions may be responsible for the serologically defined polymorphism of HLA-DR antigens. <br>

Both the alpha and beta chains of HLA-DP and HLA-DQ are polymorphic, whereas HLA-DR alpha (HLA-DRA) is invariant and HLA-DR beta (HLA-DRB; see 142857) is polymorphic (Dai et al., 2008). <br> Application of the primed lymphocyte test (PLT) led to the identification of the SB (DP) system (Shaw et al., 1980) and the PL3A system (Termijtelen et al., 1980; Termijtelen and van Rood, 1981) as separate loci in the HLA-D region coding for determinants that confer weak or moderate stimulation in primary mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) but strong stimulation in primed lymphocyte culture. Termijtelen et al. (1983) demonstrated the identity of PL3A and SB1. <br> Kavathas et al. (1981) selected HLA-mutant lymphoblastoid cell lines that had lost expression of specific genetic markers; thereby, new B-cell antigens were defined. They are called SB (secondary B-cell locus) because they evoke strong secondary allogeneic proliferative and cytotoxic responses in B cells. Separateness from HLA-DR, which the SB antigens resemble functionally, was demonstrated by the finding that the cis-linked SB antigen continued to be expressed after loss of HLA-A (142800), HLA-B (142830), and HLA-DR antigen expression in a mutagenized cell line which had a visible deletion of the region of the short arm of chromosome 6 coding for HLA. Population studies indicated that the 5 SB antigens are a single mendelian segregant series in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Both family studies (Shaw et al., 1981) and analysis of mutant cell lines (Kavathas et al., 1981) indicated the distinctness of the HLA-SB locus. Shaw et al. (1981) showed that the determinant previously described by Mawas et al. (1978, 1980) is identical to SB1. <br> Hartzman et al. (1983) described another HLA-D/SB recombinant person. <br> Gustafsson et al.

PPK has been classified into diffuse, focal, and punctate forms according to the pattern of hyperkeratosis on the palms and soles (Lucker et al., 1994). Diffuse PPK develops at birth or shortly thereafter and involves the entire palm and sole with a sharp cutoff at an erythematous border; there are no lesions outside the volar skin, and, in particular, no follicular or oral lesions. In contrast, focal PPK is a late-onset form in which focal hyperkeratotic lesions develop in response to mechanical trauma; an important distinguishing feature is the presence of lesions at other body sites, e.g., oral and follicular hyperkeratosis (Stevens et al., 1996). Palmoplantar keratodermas can be further subdivided histologically into epidermolytic and nonepidermolytic PPK (Risk et al., 1994). <br> A generalized form of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (EHK; 113800), also designated bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (BCIE), is caused by mutation in the keratin genes KRT1 and KRT10 (148080). <br>

144700=><br> The Heidelberg histologic classification of renal cell tumors subdivides renal cell tumors into benign and malignant parenchymal neoplasms and, where possible, limits each subcategory to the most common documented genetic abnormalities (Kovacs et al., 1997). Malignant tumors are subclassified into common or conventional renal cell carcinoma (clear cell); papillary renal cell carcinoma; chromophobe renal cell carcinoma; collecting duct carcinoma, with medullary carcinoma of the kidney; and unclassified renal cell carcinoma. The common or conventional type accounts for about 75% of renal cell neoplasms and is characterized genetically by a highly specific deletion of chromosome 3p. Papillary renal cell carcinoma (see 605074) accounts for about 10% of renal cell tumors. Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma accounts for approximately 5% of renal cell neoplasms. Genetically, chromophobe RCC is characterized by a combination of loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 10, 13, 17, and 21 and hypodiploid DNA content. Collecting duct carcinoma accounts for about 1% of renal cell carcinoma. <br> Renal cell carcinoma occurs nearly twice as often in men as in women; incidence in the United States is equivalent among whites and blacks (summarized by Motzer et al., 1996). Cigarette smoking doubles the likelihood of renal cell carcinoma and contributes to as many as one-third of cases. Obesity is also a risk factor, particularly in women. Other risk factors include hypertension, unopposed estrogen therapy, and occupational exposure to petroleum products, heavy metals, or asbestos. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Renal Cell Carcinoma <br> Germline mutation resulting in nonpapillary renal cell carcinoma of the clear cell and chromophobe type occurs in the HNF1A gene (142410) and the HNF1B gene (189907). <br> Somatic mutations in renal cell carcinomas occur in the VHL gene (608537), the TRC8 gene (603046), the OGG1 gene (601982), the ARMET gene (601916), and the FLCN gene (607273). <br> For a description and discussion of genetic heterogeneity of papillary renal cell carcinoma, see 605074. <br> - Occurrence of Renal Cell Carcinoma in Other Disorders <br> Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (193300) is a familial multicancer syndrome in which there is a susceptibility to a variety of neoplasms, including renal cell carcinoma of clear cell histology and renal cysts. A syndrome of predisposition to uterine leiomyomas and papillary renal cell carcinoma has been reported (605839). Medullary carcinoma of the kidney is believed to arise from the collecting ducts of the renal medulla and is associated with sickle cell trait (603903) (Kovacs et al., 1997).

In this view the person with essential hypertension is one who happens to inherit an aggregate of genes determining hypertension (and also is exposed to exogenous factors that favor hypertension). The Platt school took the view that essential hypertension is a simple mendelian dominant trait (Platt, 1963). McDonough et al. (1964) defended the monogenic idea. See McKusick (1960) and Kurtz and Spence (1993) for reviews. Swales (1985) reviewed the Platt-Pickering controversy as an 'episode in recent medical history.'

Hypertriglyceridemia is not completely expressed in affected children. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Hypertriglyceridemia <br> Hypertriglyceridemia has many causes but, whatever its cause, there is evidence for its role as a coronary heart disease risk factor. Hypertriglyceridemia is commonly found in individuals with type II diabetes mellitus (125853). Several genetic bases for hypertriglyceridemia have been identified. Familial combined hyperlipidemia (HYPLIP1; 602491) is due to variation in the USF1 gene (191523) on chromosome 1q21-q23. Some mutations in the ABCA1 gene (600046) caused Tangier disease (205400), whereas others caused a mild disorder called type II familial high density lipoprotein deficiency, or hypoalphalipoproteinemia (604091).

Domain 2 is defined primarily by a lack of sequence identity among the IGFBPs and by a lack of cysteines, though it does contain 2 cysteines in IGFBP4.

The enzyme converts adenosine to inosine in dsRNA, which destabilizes the dsRNA helix. The RNA modifying activity of DSRAD is important for various functions. Among these are site-specific RNA editing of transcripts of the glutamate receptors (see 138248), which are channels for the neurotransmitter L-glutamate in the brain. DSRAD also functions to modify viral RNA genomes and may be responsible for hypermutation of certain negative-stranded viruses, such as measles, which may result in lethal measles inclusion body encephalitis (Weier et al., 1995). <br>

The IGHM gene encodes the C region of the mu heavy chain, which defines the IgM isotype. Naive B cells express the transmembrane forms of IgM and IgD (see IGHD; 1471770) on their surface. During an antibody response, activated B cells can switch to the expression of individual downstream heavy chain C region genes by a process of somatic recombination known as isotype switching. In addition, secreted Ig forms that act as antibodies can be produced by alternative RNA processing of the heavy chain C region sequences. Although the membrane forms of all Ig isotypes are monomeric, secreted IgM forms pentamers, and occasionally hexamers, in plasma (summary by Janeway et al., 2005). <br>

FCAR interacts with aggregated IgAs, such as IgA coated on the surface of an invading microorganism, and mediates several immunologic defense processes such as phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and stimulation of the release of inflammatory mediators. FCAR is a glycoprotein of 50 to 100 kD, with diversity on different cell types. <br>

147140=><br> The IgE receptor plays a central role in allergic disease, coupling allergen and mast cell to initiate the inflammatory and immediate hypersensitivity responses that are characteristic of disorders such as hay fever and asthma. The allergic response occurs when 2 or more high-affinity IgE receptors are crosslinked via IgE molecules that in turn are bound to an allergen (antigen) molecule. A perturbation occurs that brings about the release of histamine and proteases from the granules in the cytoplasm of the mast cell and leads to the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes--potent effectors of the hypersensitivity response. The IgE receptor consists of 3 subunits: alpha, beta (147138), and gamma (147139); only the alpha subunit is glycosylated. <br>

An Ig molecule is made up of 2 identical heavy chains (see 147100) and 2 identical light chains, either kappa (see 147200) or lambda, joined by disulfide bonds so that each heavy chain is linked to a light chain and the 2 heavy chains are linked together. The kappa and lambda light chains have no apparent functional differences. Each Ig lambda light chain has an N-terminal variable (V) region containing the antigen-binding site and a C-terminal constant (C) region, encoded by a C region gene (IGLC1; 147220), that provides signaling functions. The lambda light chain V region is encoded by 2 types of genes: V genes (see 147240) and joining (J) genes. Random selection of just 1 gene of each type to assemble a V region accounts for the great diversity of V regions among Ig molecules. The lambda light chain locus on chromosome 22 contains approximately 30 functional V genes, followed by approximately 4 functional J genes. Due to polymorphism, the numbers of functional V and J genes differ among individuals (Janeway et al., 2005). <br>

Inhibin exists in 2 forms, each of which shares the same alpha subunit and, when covalently linked to 1 of 2 distinct subunits called beta-a (INHBA; 147290) and beta-b (INHBB; 147390), strongly inhibits pituitary FSH secretion. On the other hand, the dimers of 2 beta subunits, termed activin, are potent stimulators of FSH secretion and release in vitro. These beta subunits share extensive sequence homology with transforming growth factor-beta (190180). <br>

147440=><br> The somatomedins, or insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), comprise a family of peptides that play important roles in mammalian growth and development. IGF1 mediates many of the growth-promoting effects of growth hormone (GH; 139250). <br> Early studies showed that growth hormone did not directly stimulate the incorporation of sulfate into cartilage, but rather acted through a serum factor, termed 'sulfation factor,' which later became known as 'somatomedin' (Daughaday et al., 1972). Three main somatomedins have been characterized: somatomedin C (IGF1), somatomedin A (IGF2; 147470), and somatomedin B (193190) (Rotwein, 1986; Rosenfeld, 2003). <br>
147450=><br> The SOD1 gene encodes superoxide dismutase-1 (EC 1.15.1.1), a major cytoplasmic antioxidant enzyme that metabolizes superoxide radicals to molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, thus providing a defense against oxygen toxicity (Niwa et al., 2007). Soluble cytoplasmic SOD1 is a copper- and zinc-containing enzyme; the SOD1 gene maps to chromosome 21q22 (Sherman et al., 1983). SOD2 (147460) is a distinct mitochondrial enzyme that contains manganese; the SOD2 gene maps to 6q25. SOD1 is a homodimer and SOD2 a tetramer (Beckman et al., 1973). <br> Fridovich (1979) concluded that SOD1 and SOD2 evolved from different primordial genes, which is an example of analogy, not homology, and of convergent evolution. Doonan et al. (1984) cited the superoxide dismutases as an example of cytosolic and mitochondrial isoenzymes with no apparent evolutionary relationship. <br>
147460=><br> Superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2; EC 1.15.1.1.) is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that scavenges oxygen radicals produced by the extensive oxidation-reduction and electron transport reactions occurring in mitochondria. In contrast with cytoplasmic SOD1 (147450), a homodimeric copper- and zinc-containing enzyme, SOD2 (147460) is tetrameric and contains manganese (Beckman et al., 1973; Beck et al., 1987). <br>

Aberrant IFNG expression is associated with a number of autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The importance of IFNG in the immune system stems in part from its ability to inhibit viral replication directly, but most importantly derives from its immunostimulatory and immunomodulatory effects. IFNG is produced predominantly by natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells as part of the innate immune response, and by CD4 (186940) and CD8 (see 186910) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) effector T cells once antigen-specific immunity develops (Schoenborn and Wilson, 2007). <br>

As a consequence, the biologic activity of these 2 cytokines is neutralized in physiologic and pathophysiologic immune and inflammatory responses.

150240=><br> The major components of basal laminae are the glycoproteins laminin and collagen IV (see 120130), both of which are heterotrimers. Laminin is a cruciform protein trimer of chains that when originally isolated from the extracellular matrix of tumor cells, were named A, B1, and B2, but were renamed alpha-1, beta-1, and gamma-1, respectively (Burgeson et al., 1994). The laminin and collagen IV isoforms vary from one basal lamina to another and are members of multigene families. These gene families (like others, such as the globins and myosins) may provide a means of generating functional diversity within a common structural framework. <br> Laminin functions in relation to epithelial cells and type IV collagen in the manner that fibronectin (135600) does for type I collagen and tissue cells of many types and that chondronectin (118670) does for type II collagen and chondrocytes. It is present in serum in very low concentration (about 1 microg/ml) and indeed the laminin measured in serum by immunoassay may be in fragments. It binds heparin and heparin sulfate also (Kleinman, 1982). The laminin molecule, of approximately 1 million daltons, is composed of one A chain (about 400,000 daltons) and three beta chains (about 200,000 daltons), held together by interchain disulfide bonds. Three species of B chains have been described. It is likely that the laminins may vary with regard to B chain composition. The B1 and B2 laminin genes, which are coordinately regulated with alpha-1(IV) (120130) and alpha-2(IV) (120090) collagen genes, are tightly linked on mouse chromosome 1 (Elliott et al., 1985). <br>

The cardinal features of the condition are dislocations of the hip, knee and elbow joints, with equinovarus or equinovalgus foot deformities. Spatula-shaped fingers, most marked in the thumb, are also present. Craniofacial anomalies include hypertelorism, prominence of the forehead, a depressed nasal bridge, and a flattened midface. Cleft palate and short stature are often associated features. Spinal anomalies include scoliosis and cervical kyphosis. Hearing loss is a well-recognized complication (summary by Bicknell et al., 2007). <br>

Laminin has been shown to be important for cell differentiation, adhesion, migration, and neurite outgrowth. The laminin beta-2 chain, formerly S-laminin or the B1s chain, is a homolog of the laminin beta-1 (LAMB1; 150240) and beta-3 (LAMB3; 150310) chains and is located in synaptic basement membranes (Vuolteenaho et al., 1993).

Vertebrate lamins are classified into 2 types, A and B, and mammalian somatic cells show 2 species of each type: lamins A and C for the A type and B1 and B2 for the B type. In addition, germ-cell-specific lamins have been reported for both types (Furukawa and Hotta, 1993 and Furukawa et al., 1994). Whereas A-type lamins are expressed in a developmentally controlled manner, B-type lamins are expressed in all kinds of cells. <br>

150360=><br> Congenital laryngeal (glottic) webs are uncommon, membrane-like structures that extend across the laryngeal lumen near the level of the vocal cords. They are thought to result from incomplete resorption of an epithelial layer that normally obliterates the developing laryngeal opening at about the sixth week of embryologic life. This layer is usually completely eliminated by the tenth week. Most laryngeal webs occur at the glottic level and affect the vocal cords. More than 90% are located anteriorly and extend toward the arytenoids. While affected persons may have onset of manifestations at any age, with hoarse or weak voice and frequent upper respiratory infections, they usually manifest the condition as infants, with respiratory distress, stridor, and an unusual cry (Strakowski et al., 1988; Singh et al., 2009). <br>

These alternative breakpoints join different exon sets of BCR to a common subset of the exons of the ABL1 gene (189980) located on chromosome 9. This fusion results in 2 alternative chimeric oncogene products called p210(BCR-ABL) and p185(BCR-ABL).

151623=><br> Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous inherited cancer syndrome. LFS is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance and early onset of tumors, multiple tumors within an individual, and multiple affected family members. In contrast to other inherited cancer syndromes, which are predominantly characterized by site-specific cancers, LFS presents with a variety of tumor types. The most common types are soft tissue sarcomas and osteosarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, leukemia, and adrenocortical carcinoma. Classic LFS is defined as a proband with a sarcoma before the age of 45 years and a first-degree relative with any cancer before the age of 45 years and 1 additional first- or second-degree relative in the same lineage with any cancer before the age of 45 years or a sarcoma at any age (Li et al., 1988). Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFL) is defined as a proband with any childhood cancer, or a sarcoma, brain tumor, or adrenocortical tumor before the age of 45 years, plus a first- or second-degree relative in the same lineage with a typical LFS tumor at any age, and an additional first- or second-degree relative in the same lineage with any cancer before the age of 60 years (Birch et al., 1994). A less restrictive definition of LFL is 2 different LFS-related tumors in first- or second-degree relatives at any age (Eeles, 1995). Approximately 70% of LFS cases and 40% of LFL cases contain germline mutations in the p53 gene on chromosome 17p13.1. In a subset of non-p53 patients with LFS (LFS2; 609265), mutations have been identified in the CHEK2 gene (604373) on chromosome 22q11. A third LFS locus (LFS3; 609266) has been identified on chromosome 1q23 (Bachinski et al., 2005). <br>

151660=><br> Familial partial lipodystrophy is a metabolic disorder characterized by abnormal subcutaneous adipose tissue distribution beginning in late childhood or early adult life. Affected individuals gradually lose fat from the upper and lower extremities and the gluteal and truncal regions, resulting in a muscular appearance with prominent superficial veins. In some patients, adipose tissue accumulates on the face and neck, causing a double chin, fat neck, or cushingoid appearance. Metabolic abnormalities include insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus with acanthosis nigricans and hypertriglyceridemia; hirsutism and menstrual abnormalities occur infrequently. Familial partial lipodystrophy may also be referred to as lipoatrophic diabetes mellitus, but the essential feature is loss of subcutaneous fat (review by Garg, 2004). <br> The disorder may be misdiagnosed as Cushing disease (see 219080) (Kobberling and Dunnigan, 1986; Garg, 2004). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Familial Partial Lipodystrophy <br> Familial partial lipodystrophy is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. Types 1 and 2 were originally described as clinical subtypes: type 1 (FPLD1; 608600), characterized by loss of subcutaneous fat confined to the limbs (Kobberling et al., 1975), and FPLD2, characterized by loss of subcutaneous fat from the limbs and trunk (Dunnigan et al., 1974; Kobberling and Dunnigan, 1986). No genetic basis for FPLD1 has yet been delineated. FPLD3 (604367) is caused by mutation in the PPARG gene (601487) on chromosome 3p25, and FPLD4 (613877) is caused by mutation in the PLIN1 gene (170290) on chromosome 15q26. <br>

HSL regulates energy homeostasis by catalyzing the rate-limiting step in adipose tissue lipolysis. Like glycogen phosphorylase, the corresponding enzyme in carbohydrate metabolism, HSL is under acute neuronal and hormonal control. In both cases activation by catecholamines occurs through the cAMP-mediated phosphorylation of a single serine residue. The dephosphorylation of HSL by insulin is responsible for the antilipolytic effect of this hormone, one of its most important actions (summary by Holm et al., 1988). <br>

LBP and another acute-phase reactant, bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI; 109195), bind LPS with high affinity. LBP is made in the liver during the acute phase of infections and is thought to function as a carrier for LPS and to help control LPS-dependent monocyte responses.

The hydroxylysine residues formed in the lysyl hydroxylase reaction have 2 important functions: first, their hydroxy groups serve as sites of attachment for carbohydrate units, either the monosaccharide galactose or the disaccharide glucosylgalactose; and second, they are essential for the stability of the intermolecular collagen crosslinks (summary by Hautala et al., 1992). <br>
153455=><br> Lysyl oxidase (protein-lysine 6-oxidase; EC 1.4.3.13) is an extracellular copper enzyme that initiates crosslinking of collagens and elastin.

The importance of genetic factors is suggested by the observation of familial clustering of WM (McMaster, 2003). Whereas WM is rare, an asymptomatic elevation of monoclonal IgM protein, termed 'IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (IgM MGUS) is more common. Patients with IgM MGUS can progress to develop WM, at the rate of 1.5% to 2% per year (Kyle et al., 2003). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia <br> One locus for susceptibility to Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM1) maps to chromosome 6p21.3.

153618=><br> Recognition of complex carbohydrate structures plays an important role in a number of biologic processes, including cell-cell recognition, serum glycoprotein turnover, and neutralization of pathogens (Kim et al., 1992). Many of the endogenous animal lectins that mediate these recognition events share a common Ca(2+)-dependent structural motif that has been designated a C-type carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD). The mannose receptor found on macrophages and on endothelial cells of the liver is the only known example of a C-type lectin that contains multiple C-type CRDs. One function of the receptor is to bind high-mannose structures on the surface of potentially pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and fungi, so that they can be neutralized by phagocytic engulfment. <br>

Chemokines also play fundamental roles in the development, homeostasis, and function of the immune system, and they have effects on cells of the central nervous system as well as on endothelial cells involved in angiogenesis or angiostasis. Chemokines are divided into 2 major subfamilies, CXC and CC, based on the arrangement of the first 2 of the 4 conserved cysteine residues; the 2 cysteines are separated by a single amino acid in CXC chemokines and are adjacent in CC chemokines. CXC chemokines are further subdivided into ELR and non-ELR types based on the presence or absence of a glu-leu-arg sequence adjacent and N terminal to the CXC motif.

Additional symptoms are variable, and may include cataracts, hearing loss, sensory axonal neuropathy, ataxia, depression, hypogonadism, and parkinsonism. Both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance can occur; autosomal recessive inheritance is usually more severe (Filosto et al., 2003; Luoma et al., 2004). <br> PEO caused by mutation in the POLG gene is associated with more complicated phenotypes than those forms caused by mutation in the ANT1 or C10ORF2 genes (Lamantea et al., 2002). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Autosomal Dominant Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia with DNA Deletions <br> See also PEOA2 (609283), caused by mutation in the ANT1 gene (SLC25A4; 103220) on chromosome 4q34; PEOA3 (609286), caused by mutation in the twinkle gene (C10ORF2; 606075) on chromosome 10q24; PEOA4 (610131), caused by mutation in the POLG2 gene (604983) on chromosome 17q; and PEOA5 (613077), caused by mutation in the RRM2B gene (604712) on chromosome 8q23. <br>

By use of chaotropic agents, complex I can be fragmented into 3 different fractions: a flavoprotein fraction, an iron-sulfur protein (IP) fraction, and a hydrophobic protein (HP) fraction. The IP fraction contains NDUFS1, NDUFS2 (602985), NDUFS3 (603846), NDUFS4 (602694), NDUFS5 (603847), NDUFS6 (603848), and NDUFA5 (601677) (Loeffen et al., 1998). The 75-kD Fe-S protein of the mitochondrial NADH-CoQ reductase is an integral part of the respiratory chain and is one of several Fe-S proteins operating within complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain assembly (Ragan, 1987). Functionally, this enzyme is thought to be the first of the Fe-S proteins to accept electrons from an NADH-flavoprotein reductase within the complex. <br>

Permanent molars are less frequently affected than deciduous molars. The major characteristic of a secondarily retained molar is infraocclusion, which may result in malocclusion because of tilting of the neighboring teeth and overeruption of antagonists. The disorder can also result in loss of the retained molar and neighboring teeth due to caries and periodontal disease and in deformation of the facial skeleton (Raghoebar et al., 1992). <br> See also 125350 and 273050 for phenotypes with shared features of secondary retention of permanent molars. <br>

In the mildest forms, only the occipital regions of the scalp are involved; however, in severe forms the eyebrows, eyelashes, and secondary sexual hair may also be involved. Follicular hyperkeratosis with predilection for the scalp, nape of neck, and extensor surfaces of the upper arm and thighs is also a characteristic finding in these patients. Light microscopic examination is diagnostic and reveals elliptical nodes of normal thickness and intermittent constrictions (internodes) at which the hair easily breaks. There may be spontaneous improvement with time, especially during puberty and pregnancy, but the condition never resolves completely (summary by Zlotogorski et al., 2006). <br> An autosomal recessive form of monilethrix-like congenital hypotrichosis (see 607903) is caused by mutation in the DSG4 gene (607892). The clinical picture of autosomal recessive monilethrix is more severe than the dominant form, with more extensive alopecia of the scalp, body, and limbs, and a papular rash involving the extremities and periumbilical region (Zlotogorski et al., 2006). <br> The term monilethrix derives from the Latin word for necklace and the Greek for hair (Schweizer, 2006). <br>

Both molecules are critical for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-dependent signal transduction, and sCD14 confers LPS sensitivity to cells lacking mCD14.

MLL is a frequent target for recurrent translocations in acute leukemias that may be characterized as acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 601626), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or mixed lineage (biphenotypic) leukemia (MLL). Leukemias with translocations involving MLL possess unique clinical and biologic characteristics and are often associated with poor prognosis. MLL rearrangements are found in more than 70% of infant leukemias, whether the immunophenotype is more consistent with ALL or AML6, but are less frequent in leukemias from older children. MLL translocations are also found in approximately 10% of AMLs in adults, as well as in therapy-related leukemias, most often characterized as AML, that develop in patients previously treated with topoisomerase II inhibitors for other malignancies. More than 50 different MLL fusion partners have been identified. Leukemogenic MLL translocations encode MLL fusion proteins that have lost H3K4 methyltransferase activity. A key feature of MLL fusion proteins is their ability to efficiently transform hematopoietic cells into leukemia stem cells (Krivtsov and Armstrong, 2007). <br>

160900=><br> Myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized mainly by myotonia, muscular dystrophy, cataracts, hypogonadism, frontal balding, and ECG changes. The genetic defect in DM1 results from an amplified trinucleotide repeat in the 3-prime untranslated region of a protein kinase gene. Disease severity varies with the number of repeats: normal individuals have 5 to 37 repeats, mildly affected persons have 50 to 150 repeats, patients with classic DM have 100 to 1,000 repeats, and those with congenital onset can have more than 2,000 repeats. The disorder shows genetic anticipation, with expansion of the repeat number dependent on the sex of the transmitting parent. Alleles of 40 to 80 repeats are usually expanded when transmitted by males, whereas only alleles longer than 80 repeats tend to expand in maternal transmissions. Repeat contraction events occur 4.2 to 6.4% of the time (Musova et al., 2009). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Myotonic Dystrophy <br> See also myotonic dystrophy-2 (DM2; 602668), which is caused by mutation in the ZNF9 gene (116955) on chromosome 3q. <br>

Carney complex may simultaneously involve multiple endocrine glands, similar to classic MEN syndromes (MEN1; 131100 and MEN2; 171400). Carney complex shows some similarities to McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS; 174800), a sporadic condition that is also characterized by multiple endocrine and nonendocrine tumors, and shares skin abnormalities and some nonendocrine tumors with the lentiginoses and certain of the hamartomatoses, particularly Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS; 175200). Carney complex is often associated with the unusual large-cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumor and psammomatous melanotic schwannomas (Kirschner et al., 2000; Stratakis et al., 2001). <br>

N-myristoyltransferase (NMT; EC 2.3.1.97) catalyzes the transfer of myristate from CoA to proteins. N-myristoylation appears to be irreversible and is required for full expression of the biologic activities of several N-myristoylated proteins, including the alpha subunit of the signal-transducing guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) GO (GNAO1; 139311) (Duronio et al., 1992). <br>

Familial cases are the exception rather than the rule, and monozygotic twins show only partial concordance (25 to 31%) (Mignot, 1998). <br> Adie (1926) first delineated narcolepsy as a separate and specific entity. It is a sleep disorder characterized by attacks of disabling daytime drowsiness and low alertness. The normal physiologic components of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, dreaming and loss of muscle tone, are separated and also occur while the subject is awake, resulting in half-sleep dreams and episodes of skeletal muscle paralysis and atonia (cataplexy and sleep paralysis). Unlike normal sleep, that of narcolepsy often begins with REM activity and the time taken to fall asleep is shorter than normal. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Narcolepsy <br> A mutation in the hypocretin gene (HCRT; 602358) on chromosome 17q21 has been demonstrated in 1 patient with narcolepsy. Additional narcolepsy loci have been mapped to chromosomes 4 (NRCLP2; 605841), 21q (NRCLP3; 609039), 22q13 (NRCLP4; 612417), and 14q11 (NRCLP5; 612851). Resistance to narcolepsy is associated with minor alleles of a SNP and a marker in the NLC1A gene (610259) on chromosome 21q22. <br>

IL12 is composed of 40-kD (p40, or IL12B; 161561) and 35-kD (p35) subunits and functions to activate and link the innate and acquired immune responses (Wolf et al., 1994). IL35, an inhibitory cytokine involved in regulatory T-cell function, is composed of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced gene-3 (EBI3; 605816) and the ubiquitously expressed p35 subunit of IL12 (Niedbala et al., 2007; Collison et al., 2007). <br>

161800=><br> Nemaline myopathy is a form of congenital myopathy characterized by abnormal thread- or rod-like structures in muscle fibers on histologic examination ('nema' is Greek for 'thread'). The clinical phenotype is highly variable, with differing age at onset and severity. Muscle weakness typically involves proximal muscles, with involvement of the facial, bulbar, and respiratory muscles (Ilkovski et al., 2001). Attempts at classification of nemaline myopathies into clinical subtypes have been complicated by the overlap of clinical features and a continuous phenotypic spectrum of disease (North et al., 1997; Wallgren-Pettersson et al., 1999; Ryan et al., 2001; Sanoudou and Beggs, 2001). In general, 2 clinical groups can be readily distinguished: 'typical' and 'severe.' Typical nemaline myopathy is the most common form, presenting as infantile hypotonia and muscle weakness. It is slowly progressive or nonprogressive, and most adults achieve ambulation. The severe form of the disorder is characterized by absence of spontaneous movement or respiration at birth, arthrogryposis, and death in the first months of life. Much less commonly, late-childhood or even adult-onset can occur. However, adult-onset nemaline myopathy is usually not familial and may represent a different disease (Wallgren-Pettersson et al., 1999; Sanoudou and Beggs, 2001). <br> Myopathy caused by mutations in the ACTA1 gene can show a range of clinical and pathologic phenotypes. Some patients have classic rods, whereas other may also show intranuclear rods, clumped filaments, cores, or fiber-type disproportion (see 255310), all of which are nonspecific pathologic findings and not pathognomonic of a specific congenital myopathy. The spectrum of clinical phenotypes caused by mutations in ACTA1 may result from different mutations, modifying factors affecting the severity of the disorder, variability in clinical care, or a combination of these factors (Nowak et al, 1999; Kaindl et al., 2004). <br>

161950=><br> End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a major public health problem, affecting 1 in 1,000 individuals and with an annual death rate of 20% despite dialysis treatment. IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common form of glomerulonephritis, a principal cause of ESRD worldwide, affecting up to 1.3% of the population. Kidneys of patients with IgA nephropathy show deposits of IgA-containing immune complexes with proliferation of the glomerular mesangium. Typical clinical features include onset before age 40 with hematuria and proteinuria, and episodes of gross hematuria following mucosal infections are common; 30% of patients develop progressive renal failure. Although not generally considered a hereditary disease, striking ethnic variation in prevalence (Julian et al., 1985; D'Amico, 1987) and familial clustering (Scolari et al., 1999), along with subclinical renal abnormalities among relatives of cases, suggest a genetic component (Gharavi et al., 2000). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of IgA Nephropathy <br> A locus for familial IgA nephropathy, called IGAN1, on 6q22-q23, was described by Gharavi et al. (2000). Another locus, IGAN2 (613944), was identified by Paterson et al. (2007) on chromosome 2q36. <br> Bisceglia et al. (2006) identified suggestive linkage to chromosomes 4q26-q31 and 17q12-q22 (see HETEROGENEITY). Polymorphism in the ACE (106180) and AGT (106150) genes has been associated with progression to chronic renal failure in patients with IgA nephropathy. <br>

162010=><br> Bothwell (1996), Carter and Lewin (1997), and Bibel and Barde (2000) reviewed neurotrophins and their receptors. Nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) is also referred to as p75(NTR) due to its molecular mass and its ability to bind at low affinity not only NGF (see 162030), but also other neurotrophins, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; 113505), neurotrophin-3 (NTF3; 162660), and neurotrophin-4 (NTF4; 162662). At the time of its discovery, NGFR was considered a unique type of protein. Subsequently, however, a large superfamily of tumor necrosis factor receptors were found to share the overall structure of NGFR (4 extracellular ligand-binding, cysteine-rich repeats, or CRs, and signaling through association with, or disassociation from, cytoplasmic interactors). The identification of this superfamily helped elucidate some of the biologic functions of NGFR, including its ultimate involvement in the nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011) and apoptosis pathways. As a monomer, NGFR binds NGF with low affinity. Higher affinity binding is achieved by association with higher molecular mass, low-affinity neurotrophin receptors, namely the tropomyosin receptor kinases, TRKA (NTRK1; 191315), TRKB (NTRK2; 600456), and TRKC (NTRK3; 191316). TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC are specific for or 'preferred by' NGF, NTF4 and BDNF, and NTF3, respectively (Ip et al., 1993). NTF3 also binds to TRKA and TRKB, but with significantly lower affinity. <br>

162151=><br> The subtilisin-like proprotein convertases are expressed extensively in mammalian neural and endocrine cells and play a major role in the proteolytic processing of both neuropeptide and peptide hormone precursors.

162200=><br> Neurofibromatosis type I is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by cafe-au-lait spots, Lisch nodules in the eye, and fibromatous tumors of the skin. Individuals with the disorder have increased susceptibility to the development of benign and malignant tumors. NF1 is sometimes referred to as 'peripheral neurofibromatosis.' The worldwide incidence of NF1 is 1 in 2,500 to 1 in 3,000 individuals (reviews by Shen et al., 1996 and Williams et al., 2009). <br> Type II neurofibromatosis (NF2; 101000) is a genetically distinct disorder caused by mutation in the gene encoding merlin (NF2; 607379) on chromosome 22q12. NF2, sometimes known as 'central neurofibromatosis,' is characterized by bilateral acoustic neuroma and meningioma, but few skin lesions or neurofibromas (Rouleau et al., 1993). <br> Some patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in mismatch repair genes (see, e.g., MLH1; 120436 and MSH2; 609309) have a phenotype characterized by early onset malignancies and mild features of NF1, especially cafe-au-lait spots; this is known as the mismatch repair cancer syndrome (276300), sometimes referred to as brain tumor-polyposis syndrome-1 or Turcot syndrome. These patients typically do not have germline mutations in the NF1 gene, although a study by Wang et al. (2003) suggested that biallelic mutations in mismatch repair genes may cause somatic mutations in the NF1 gene, perhaps resulting in isolated features resembling NF1. <br> See also Legius syndrome (611431), a genetically distinct disorder with a similar phenotype to NF1. <br>

The NFKB complex is inhibited by I-kappa-B proteins (NFKBIA or NFKBIB, 604495), which inactivate NF-kappa-B by trapping it in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of serine residues on the I-kappa-B proteins by kinases (IKBKA, 600664, or IKBKB, 603258) marks them for destruction via the ubiquitination pathway, thereby allowing activation of the NF-kappa-B complex. Activated NFKB complex translocates into the nucleus and binds DNA at kappa-B-binding motifs such as 5-prime GGGRNNYYCC 3-prime or 5-prime HGGARNYYCC 3-prime (where H is A, C, or T; R is an A or G purine; and Y is a C or T pyrimidine). <br>

NFKB is activated by a wide variety of stimuli such as cytokines, oxidant-free radicals, inhaled particles, ultraviolet irradiation, and bacterial or viral products. Inappropriate activation of NF-kappa-B has been linked to inflammatory events associated with autoimmune arthritis, asthma, septic shock, lung fibrosis, glomerulonephritis, atherosclerosis, and AIDS. In contrast, complete and persistent inhibition of NF-kappa-B has been linked directly to apoptosis, inappropriate immune cell development, and delayed cell growth. For reviews, see Chen et al.

However, the p100 and p105 proteins serve regulatory functions and should not be considered exclusively as precursor forms. The most abundant activated form of NF-kappa-B is a heterodimer of the p50 or p52 subunit bound to the RELA subunit (164014). Other NF-kappa-B complexes, consisting of hetero- and homodimers of p50, p52, RELA, REL (164910), and RELB (604758), have also been detected.

At least 20 of these proteins, designated A1 (34 kD) through U (120 kD), are present in abundance. In the nucleus they are found in association with a specific set of proteins to form ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) particles. In vertebrates, the C proteins, C1 and C2, are major constituents of these particles.

Defects in leptin production cause severe hereditary obesity in rodents and humans. In addition to its effects on body weight, leptin has a variety of other functions, including the regulation of hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, wound healing, and the immune and inflammatory response. Leptin acts through the leptin receptor (LEPR; 601007), a single-transmembrane-domain receptor of the cytokine receptor family, which is found in many tissues in several alternatively spliced forms. The LEP gene is the human homolog of the gene (ob) mutant in the mouse 'obese' phenotype. <br>

Characteristic facial features include a narrow, pinched nose with hypoplastic alae nasi, prominent columella and thin anteverted nares together with a narrow nasal bridge, and prominent epicanthic folds giving the impression of hypertelorism. The teeth are usually small and carious. Typical eye findings include microphthalmia and microcornea. The characteristic digital malformation is complete syndactyly of the fourth and fifth fingers (syndactyly type III) but the third finger may be involved and associated camptodactyly is a common finding (Judisch et al., 1979). Neurologic abnormalities are sometimes associated (Gutmann et al., 1991). <br>

Olfactory receptors are encoded by an extremely large subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. These receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. They are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The genes encoding these receptors are devoid of introns within their coding regions, but have a long intron splicing the 5-prime untranslated region. <br> OR1D2 is believed to function in human sperm chemotaxis and may be a critical component of the fertilization process (Spehr et al., 2003). <br>

164400=><br> The autosomal dominant cerebellar degenerative disorders are generally referred to as 'spinocerebellar ataxias,' (SCAs) even though 'spinocerebellar' is a hybrid term, referring to both clinical signs and neuroanatomical regions (Margolis, 2003). Neuropathologists have defined SCAs as cerebellar ataxias with variable involvement of the brainstem and spinal cord, and the clinical features of the disorders are caused by degeneration of the cerebellum and its afferent and efferent connections, which involve the brainstem and spinal cord (Schols et al., 2004; Taroni and DiDonato, 2004). <br> Historically, Harding (1982) proposed a clinical classification for autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs). ADCA I was characterized by cerebellar ataxia in combination with various associated neurologic features, such as ophthalmoplegia, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, peripheral neuropathy, and dementia, among others. ADCA II was characterized by the cerebellar ataxia, associated neurologic features, and the additional findings of macular and retinal degeneration. ADCA III was a pure form of late-onset cerebellar ataxia without additional features. SCA1, SCA2 (183090), and SCA3, or Machado-Joseph disease (109150), are considered to be forms of ADCA I. These 3 disorders are characterized at the molecular level by CAG repeat expansions on 6p24-p23, 12q24.1, and 14q32.1, respectively. SCA7 (607640), caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN7 gene (607640) on chromosome 3p13-p12, is a form of ADCA II. SCA5 (600224), SCA31 (117210), SCA6 (183086), and SCA11 (600432) are associated with phenotypes most suggestive of ADCA III. However, Schelhaas et al. (2000) noted that there is significant phenotypic overlap between different forms of SCA as well as significant phenotypic variability within each subtype. <br> Classic reviews of olivopontocerebellar atrophies and of inherited ataxias in general include those of Konigsmark and Weiner (1970), who identified 5 types of olivopontocerebellar atrophy, Berciano (1982), Harding (1993), Schelhaas et al.

164730=><br> Phosphoinositide 3-kinases, or PI3Ks (see PIK3CA; 171834), generate specific inositol lipids implicated in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, survival, differentiation, and cytoskeletal changes. One of the best characterized targets of PI3K lipid products is the protein kinase AKT, or protein kinase B (PKB). In quiescent cells, PKB resides in the cytosol in a low-activity conformation. Upon cellular stimulation, PKB is activated through recruitment to cellular membranes by PI3K lipid products and by phosphorylation by 3-prime phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDPK1; 605213). For a review of the mechanism that activates PKB and the downstream actions of this multifunctional kinase, see Vanhaesebroeck and Alessi (2000).

164750=><br> An omphalocele is an abdominal wall defect limited to an open umbilical ring, and is characterized by the herniation of membrane-covered internal organs into the open base of the umbilical cord. Omphalocele is distinguished from gastroschisis (230750), in which the abdominal wall defect is located laterally to a normally closed umbilical ring with herniation of organs that are uncovered by membranes (summary by Bugge, 2010). On the basis of clinical manifestations, epidemiologic characteristics, and the presence of additional malformations, Yang et al. (1992) concluded that omphalocele and gastroschisis are casually and pathogenetically distinct abdominal wall defects. <br> Omphalocele can be a feature of genetic disorders, such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (130650) and the Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (182210). <br>

(The name JUN comes from the Japanese 'ju-nana,' meaning the number 17.) JUN was originally thought to be identical to the transcription factor AP1. However, it is now known that AP1 is not a single protein, but constitutes a group of related dimeric basic region-leucine zipper proteins that belong to the JUN, FOS (164810), MAF (177075), and ATF (see 603148) subfamilies. The various dimers recognize either 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) response elements or cAMP response elements. JUN is the most potent transcriptional activator in its group, and its transcriptional activity is attenuated and sometimes antagonized by JUNB (165161).

165720=><br> Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease of the joints characterized by degradation of the hyaline articular cartilage and remodeling of the subchondral bone with sclerosis (Meulenbelt et al., 2006). Clinical problems include pain and joint stiffness often leading to significant disability and joint replacement. Osteoarthritis exhibits a clear predilection for specific joints; it appears most commonly in the hip and knee joints and lumbar and cervical spine, as well as in the distal interphalangeal and the first carpometacarpal (base of thumb) and proximal interphalangeal joints of the hand; however, patients with osteoarthritis may have 1, a few, or all of these sites affected (Stefansson et al., 2003). According to a conservative estimate, greater than 70% of the population of the United States at age 65 years is affected by the disease, reflecting its age dependence. <br>
165800=><br> The skeletal disorder osteochondritis dissecans is defined as a separation of cartilage and subchondral bone from the surrounding tissue and primarily affects the knee, ankle, and elbow joints. Familial osteochondritis dissecans is characterized by multiple osteochondritic lesions in knees and/or hips and/or elbows, disproportionate short stature, and early-onset osteoarthritis (OA) (summary by Stattin et al., 2010). <br> The term 'dissecans' comes from 'dis' meaning 'from' and 'secare' meaning 'cut off,' and is not to be confused with 'desiccans' derived from 'desiccare' meaning to 'dry up.' Dissecans refers to the appearance of part of the bone having been cut away. <br>

In most cases, 'functional null' alleles of COL1A1 on chromosome 17 or COL1A2 on chromosome 7 lead to reduced amounts of normal collagen I. <br>
166210=><br> Osteogenesis imperfecta type II constitutes a disorder characterized by bone fragility, with many perinatal fractures, severe bowing of long bones, undermineralization, and death in the perinatal period due to respiratory insufficiency (Sillence et al., 1979; Barnes et al., 2006). The form here designated type IIA refers to the autosomal dominant form caused by mutation in 1 of the 2 genes that encode the chains of type I collagen, COL1A1 (120150) or COL1A2 (120160). Another form, here designated type IIB (610854), is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by mutation in the CRTAP gene (605497). <br>
166220=><br> Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a connective tissue disorder that is caused by an abnormality of type I collagen in over 90% of cases. Due to considerable phenotypic variability, Sillence et al. (1979) developed a classification of OI subtypes: OI type I with blue sclerae (166200); perinatal lethal OI type II, also known as congenital OI (166210); OI type III, a progressively deforming form with normal sclera (259420); and OI type IV, with normal sclerae. Levin et al. (1978) suggested that OI subtypes could be further divided into types A and B based on the absence or presence of dentinogenesis imperfecta. <br>

Progressive destruction of the carpal and tarsal bone usually occurs and other bones may also be involved. Chronic renal failure is a frequent component of the syndrome. Mental retardation and minor facial anomalies have been noted in some patients. Autosomal dominant inheritance has been documented in many families (Pai and Macpherson, 1988). <br> See also Torg-Winchester syndrome (259600), an autosomal recessive multicentric osteolysis syndrome. <br>

However, patients with PPHP have a constellation of physical findings referred to as Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO; see 103580) that is often not seen in patients with POH. Bastepe and Juppner (2005) suggested that POH may be an extreme end of the spectrum of the AHO features seen in PPHP. <br>

Patients are often asymptomatic, but some suffer from pain and hearing loss. It appears to be the only type of osteopetrosis not associated with an increased fracture rate. <br>
166700=><br> Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder manifest by multiple subcutaneous nevi or nodules. They may be either elastin-rich (elastoma) or collagen-rich (dermatofibrosis lenticularis disseminata) on histologic examination. The lesions are usually nontender and firm. Affected individuals also have osteopoikilosis (OPK), literally meaning 'spotted bones,' which are osteosclerotic foci that occur in the epiphyses and metaphyses of long bones, wrist, foot, ankle, pelvis, and scapula. Some individuals have both skin and bone manifestations, whereas others may lack skin or bone manifestations. Some individuals may also have melorheostosis (155950), which is characterized by 'flowing' hyperostosis of the cortex of tubular bones. Most reported cases of BOS and OPK are benign, and the bone lesions are found incidentally, although some patients may have joint pain (reviews by Hellemans et al., 2004 and Zhang et al., 2009). <br>

These typical features relate to the biology of the disease, which is a principal determinant of outcome (Auersperg et al., 2001). Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most common form and encompasses 5 major histologic subtypes: papillary serous, endometrioid, mucinous, clear cell, and transitional cell. Epithelial ovarian cancer arises as a result of genetic alterations sustained by the ovarian surface epithelium (Stany et al., 2008; Soslow, 2008). <br>

While disorders such as cystinuria (220100) and primary hyperoxaluria (see 259900) that have nephrolithiasis as a major feature have advanced understanding of the metabolic and physiologic processes of stone formation in general, they have not addressed the etiology of calcium oxalate stone formation, responsible for approximately 75% of urolithiasis cases in humans. Men are affected twice as often as women, but children show no such gender bias. The recurrence rate is also high. In populations of European ancestry, 5 to 10% of adults experience the painful precipitation of calcium oxalate in their urinary tracts. <br> Thorleifsson et al. (2009) noted that between 35 and 65% of hypercalciuric stone formers and up to 70% of subjects with hypercalciuria have relatives with nephrolithiasis, and twin studies have estimated the heritability of kidney stones to be 56%. <br>

PPY may be important in regulation of food intake; genetically obese laboratory animals have altered PPY release and in New Zealand obese mice weight gain can be cured by infusion of PPY.

167870=><br> The DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) defines panic disorder as the spontaneous, unexpected occurrence of panic attacks followed by persistent concern, worry, and anxiety about having additional panic attacks. Panic attacks are defined as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which at least 4 of 13 symptom criteria are met that develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes. Some of these criteria include cardiac palpitations, sweating, feelings of choking, fear of losing control, and fear of dying. Panic disorder is divided into panic disorder with or without accompanying agoraphobia. However, agoraphobia can also occur without panic disorder, and panic attacks can occur in the absence of panic disorder. Comorbidity with depressive and addictive disorders is frequent. <br> Barlow et al. (1994) and Smoller and Tsuang (1998) noted that because the diagnostic criteria remain purely clinical, the nosology of anxiety disorders, such as panic disorder, is controversial and evolving. Therefore, it is difficult to do genetic studies because of the difficulty in delineating overlapping phenotypes within the broader context of anxiety disorders. For example, there may be overlap of panic with specific phobias, variable expressivity of panic and anxiety or depression, or phenocopies within a family. The terms 'anxiety neurosis' and 'phobic neurosis' were used in the past (before the DSM-III in 1980) to encompass all of these disorders. Smoller and Tsuang (1998) suggested that dimensional personality traits, such as shyness, behavioral inhibition, and neuroticism (see 607834), could be used to define an anxiety phenotype. <br>

Nonchromaffin types primarily serve as chemoreceptors (hence, the tumor name 'chemodectomas') and are located in the head and neck region (i.e., carotid body, jugular, vagal, and tympanic regions), whereas chromaffin types have endocrine activity, conventionally referred to as 'pheochromocytomas,' and are usually located below the head and neck (i.e., adrenal medulla and pre- and paravertebral thoracoabdominal regions). PGL can manifest as nonchromaffin head and neck tumors only, adrenal and/or extraadrenal pheochromocytomas only, or a combination of the 2 types of tumors (Baysal, 2002; Neumann et al., 2004). <br> The triad of gastric leiomyosarcoma, pulmonary chondroma, and extraadrenal paraganglioma constitutes a syndrome that occurs mainly in young women and is known as the Carney triad (604287).

In addition, CCND1 has a number of cell cycle- and CDK-independent functions. CCND1 associates with and regulates transcription factors, coactivators, and corepressors that govern histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling proteins. CCND1 also has roles in cellular growth, metabolism, and cellular differentiation.

Feany (2004) reviewed the genetics of Parkinson disease and provided a speculative model of interactions among proteins implicated in PD. Lees et al. (2009) provided a review of Parkinson disease, with emphasis on diagnosis, neuropathology, and treatment. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Parkinson Disease  <br> Several gene loci implicated in autosomal dominant forms of Parkinson disease have been identified, including PARK1 (168601) and PARK4, due to mutation in or triplication of the alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA; 163890), respectively, on 4q22.1; PARK5 (191342), due to mutation in the UCHL1 gene on 4p14; PARK8 (607060), due to mutation in the LRRK2 gene (609007) on 12q12; PARK11 (607688), due to mutation in the GIGYF2 gene (612003) on 2q37; and PARK13 (610297), due to mutation in the HTRA2 gene (606441) on 2p12. <br> Several loci for autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson disease have been identified: PARK2 (600116), caused by mutation in the gene encoding parkin (PARK2; 602544) on 6q25.2-q27; PARK6 (605909), caused by mutation in the PINK1 gene (608309) on 1p36; PARK7 (606324), caused by mutation in the DJ1 gene (PARK7; 602533) on 1p36; PARK14 (612953), caused by mutation in the PLA2G6 gene (603604) on 22q13; and PARK15 (260300), caused by mutation in the FBXO7 gene (605648) on 22q12-q13. <br> PARK3 (602404) has been mapped to chromosome 2p13; PARK10 (606852) has been mapped to chromosome 1p34-p32; PARK16 (613164) has been mapped to chromosome 1q32. A locus on the X chromosome has been identified (PARK12; 300557). There is also evidence that mitochondrial mutations may cause or contribute to Parkinson disease (see 556500). <br> Susceptibility to the development of the more common late-onset form of Parkinson disease has been associated with polymorphisms or mutations in several genes, including GBA (606463), MAPT (157140), MC1R (155555), ADH1C (103730), and genes at the HLA locus (see, e.g., HLA-DRA; 142860). Each of these risk factors independently may have a modest effect on disease development, but together may have a substantial cumulative effect (Hamza et al., 2010). <br> Susceptibility to PD may also be conferred by expanded trinucleotide repeats in several genes causing other neurologic disorders usually characterized by spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), including the ATXN2 (601517), ATXN3 (607047), TBP (600075), and ATXN8OS (603680) genes. <br>

PON1 also hydrolyzes aromatic esters, preferably those of acetic acid. In addition, PON1 hydrolyzes a variety of aromatic and aliphatic lactones, and it also catalyzes the reverse reaction, lactonization, of gamma- and delta-hydroxycarboxylic acids. Human PON1 is synthesized in liver and secreted into blood, where it is associated exclusively with high density lipoproteins (HDLs) and may protect against development of atherosclerosis (Draganov et al., 2005). <br>

Facial dysmorphism may include low hairline and hirsutism, saddle nose, ocular hypertelorism, micrognathia, a high-arched palate, mandibular protrusion, and exophthalmos. Clinical manifestations are usually detectable after birth or in early childhood, but late-onset cases have been reported (summary by Lupi et al., 2008). <br>

P-glycoproteins were initially thought to affect the permeability of cells to drugs, but they were later found to act as pumps able to extrude drugs from cells at the cost of ATP hydrolysis. P-glycoproteins belong to a class of vectorial transport proteins known as the ATP-binding cassette transporter proteins. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR; 602421) is a member of the family but functions as a chloride channel and has no known active transport function. Defense against xenobiotics may be a major natural function of these P-glycoproteins. The P-glycoproteins have 2 homologous halves, each with 6 hydrophobic segments adjacent to a consensus sequence for nucleotide binding. The hydrophobic segments may form a membrane channel, whereas the nucleotide binding site may be involved in energization of drug transport. <br>

These 3 sequential reactions are involved in the interconversion of 1-carbon derivatives of tetrahydrofolate (THF) which are substrates for methionine, thymidylate, and de novo purine syntheses. In eukaryotes, the 3 enzymatic activities are properties of a single protein, a homodimer of 100-kD polypeptides.

Phosphorylase kinase is a hexadecameric enzyme comprising 4 copies each of 4 unique subunits encoded by 4 different genes: alpha (PHKA1 (311870) and PHKA2 (300798), the skeletal muscle and hepatic isoforms, respectively); beta (PHKB); gamma (PHKG1 (172470) and PHKG2 (172471), the skeletal muscle and hepatic isoforms, respectively); and delta. The delta subunit can be encoded by 3 different genes (CALM1, 114180, CALM2, 114182, or CALM3, 114183). The beta subunit is the same in both the muscle and hepatic isoforms. The gamma subunits contain the active site of the enzyme, whereas the alpha and beta subunits have regulatory functions controlled by phosphorylation.

In addition to control of intracellular RNases, the inhibitor may have a role in the regulation of angiogenin (105850). Ribonuclease inhibitor, of 50,000 Da, binds to ribonucleases and holds them in a latent form.

The main function of plasmin is to dissolve fibrin (see, e.g., FGA, 134820) clots. Plasmin, like trypsin, belongs to the family of serine proteinases (Miyata et al., 1982; Forsgren et al., 1987). <br>

PLAT and PLAU proteolytically activate plasminogen (PLG; 173350) into plasmin, which breaks down fibrin clots. Thus, SERPINE1 negatively regulates fibrinolysis and impairs the dissolution of clots (Ginsburg et al., 1986; Mehta and Shapiro, 2008). <br>

It is also a major constituent of the endothelial cell intercellular junction, where up to an estimated 1 million molecules are concentrated. Because of this cellular expression pattern, PECAM1 is implicated in several functions, including transendothelial migration of leukocytes, angiogenesis, and integrin activation. Ig superfamily mediate cell adhesion (e.g., NCAM1 (116930), ICAM1 (147840), and VCAM1 (192225)) or antigen recognition (e.g., immunoglobulins, T-cell receptors, and MHC molecules). In addition, a subgroup comprising 30 members characterized by the presence of 1 or more immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) within their cytoplasmic domains has also been recognized.

Since thrombospondins are widely distributed proteins involved in a variety of adhesive processes, GP IV may have important functions as a cell adhesion molecule. Other platelet glycoproteins include GP Ib (606672), the platelet receptor for thrombin (176930) and von Willebrand factor (231200), and the complex of GP IIb (607759) and GP IIIa (173470), the platelet-binding site for fibrinogen and fibronectin (134820) (see review by Greenwalt et al., 1992). <br>

It forms a 1-to-1 noncovalent complex with glycoprotein Ib (GP Ib), a platelet surface membrane glycoprotein complex that functions as a receptor for von Willebrand factor (VWF; 613160). The main portion of the receptor is a heterodimer composed of 2 polypeptide chains, an alpha chain (GP1BA; 606672) and a beta chain (GP1BB; 138720), that are linked by disulfide bonds. The complete receptor complex includes noncovalent association of the alpha and beta subunits with GP9 and platelet glycoprotein V (GP5; 173511) (review by Lopez et al., 1998). <br>

173850=><br> PVR, or CD155, belongs to a large family of immunoglobulin (Ig)-like molecules called nectins and nectin-like proteins, which mediate cell-cell adhesion, cell migration, and cell polarization by homotypic contact or heterotypic interaction with other nectins. In addition, PVR serves as the entry receptor for poliovirus and thereby mediates human susceptibility to poliovirus infection (summary by Fuchs et al., 2004). <br>

173870=><br> The chromatin-associated enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (ADPRT; EC 2.4.2.30) uses NAD as substrate to catalyze both the covalent transfer of ADP-ribose to a variety of nuclear protein acceptors and subsequently the transfer of an additional 60 to 80 ADP-ribose units to the initial moiety. Nuclear proteins that become predominantly poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated include nucleosomal core histones, histone H1 (see 142711), HMG proteins (see 163910), and topoisomerases I (126420) and II (see 126430). ADP ribosyltransferase is required for cellular repair. Inhibitors of this enzyme potentiate the lethal effects of noxious agents. During repair, NAD+ is consumed and the NAD+ content of the cell decreases. Concomitantly, nuclear proteins are ADP-ribosylated. The enzyme is induced by single-strand breaks in DNA which serve as cosubstrate for the reaction. <br>

173900=><br> Adult polycystic kidney disease is an autosomal dominant disorder with the cardinal manifestations of renal cysts, liver cysts, and intracranial aneurysm. Genetic heterogeneity is recognized, with one locus (PKD1), responsible for the most common form. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Polycystic Kidney Disease <br> Polycystic kidney disease-2 (613095) is caused by mutation in the PKD2 gene (173910) on chromosome 4q21-q23. At least 1 other locus exists; see 600666. <br>
173910=><br> The PKD2 gene encodes polycystin-2, which belongs to the superfamily of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Polycystin-2 is a large-conductance, Ca(2+)-permeable nonselective cation channel involved in Ca(2+) transport and Ca(2+) signaling in renal epithelial cells. Like other prototypical TRP channels, polycystin-2 has 6 transmembrane domains and cytoplasmic N and C termini. TRP channels, including polycystin-2, assemble as homo- and heteromultimers, particularly tetramers, and this heteromerization is thought to provide functional and regulatory diversity among channel complexes (Zhang et al., 2009). <br>
174000=><br> Medullary cystic kidney disease (MCKD) is an autosomal dominant form of tubulointerstitial nephropathy characterized by formation of renal cysts at the corticomedullary junction. It is characterized by adult onset of impaired renal function and salt wasting resulting in end-stage renal failure by the sixth decade (Wolf et al., 2004). <br> Although early reports suggested that medullary cystic kidney disease and familial juvenile nephronophthisis (NPHP1; 256100) represented the same disease entity because of the overlapping phenotype (Chamberlin et al., 1977), they are now considered to be distinct disorders. MCKD has adult onset and shows autosomal dominant inheritance, whereas NPHP1 has juvenile onset and shows autosomal recessive inheritance (Christodoulou et al., 1998). NPHP1 is caused by mutation in the nephrocystin gene (NPHP1; 607100) on chromosome 2q13. <br> See also MCKD2 (603860), which is caused by mutation in the UMOD gene (191845) on chromosome 16p. <br>

In a comprehensive review of PTEN, Waite and Eng (2002) concluded that juvenile intestinal polyposis is not a so-called PTEN hamartoma-tumor syndrome (PHTS).

Acute intermittent porphyria, the most common form of porphyria, is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of abdominal pain, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and neurologic disturbances. In the classic form of AIP, both the ubiquitous 'nonerythroid' housekeeping HMBS isoform and the 'erythroid' HMBS isoform are deficient. However, about 5% of families have the 'nonerythroid variant' of AIP, with a defect only in the ubiquitous nonerythroid HMBS isoform and normal levels of the erythroid HMBS isoform. Clinical characteristics in the 2 forms are identical; diagnostic methods based on the level of enzyme in erythrocytes is ineffective (Puy et al., 1998; Petrides, 1998; Whatley et al., 2000). <br> There are several other forms of porphyria: see porphyria cutanea tarda (176100), variegata porphyria (176200), coproporphyria (121300), acute hepatic porphyria (125270), and congenital erythropoietic porphyria (263700). <br>

It is a homotetrameric protein synthesized mainly in liver, choroid plexus, retinal pigment epithelium, and pancreas. Mutant and wildtype TTR give rise to various forms of amyloid deposition (amyloidosis), originally defined pathologically by the formation and aggregation of misfolded proteins which result in extracellular deposits that impair organ function. The clinical syndromes associated with TTR aggregation are familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) and cardiomyopathy (FAP), in which mutant TTR protein aggregates in peripheral and autonomic nerves and heart, respectively; and senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA), a late-onset disorder in which wildtype protein deposits primarily in heart, but also in gut and carpal tunnel. <br>

176795=><br> The melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a cyclic neuropeptide isolated initially from salmon pituitary gland and later from rat hypothalamus. In mammals, MCH perikarya are confined largely to the lateral hypothalamus and zona incerta area with extensive neuronal projections throughout the brain, including the neurohypophysis. The anatomic distribution suggests a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator role for MCH in a broad array of neuronal functions directed toward the regulation of goal-directed behavior, such as food intake, and general arousal. MCH and 2 other putative neuropeptides, NEI and NGE, are encoded by the same precursor and appear colocalized in nerve cells and in many instances within the projections. The precursor is designated pro-melanin-concentrating hormone (PMCH) (summary by Nahon et al., 1992). <br>

176801=><br> The PSAP gene encodes prosaposin, a precursor of several small nonenzymatic glycoproteins termed 'sphingolipid activator proteins' (SAPs) that assist in the lysosomal hydrolysis of sphingolipids (O'Brien and Kishimoto, 1991). <br> O'Brien and Kishimoto (1991) proposed a classification of the saposins based on the placement of 4 activating polypeptides in the PSAP precursor protein from the amino to carboxy termini: A, B, C, and D. After proteolytic processing of the presaposin protein, these 4 released polypeptides are functional activators. The authors noted that there has been a confusing array of terms for these proteins, and provided a table of updated nomenclature. For example, saposin B was formerly referred to as 'SAP1,' saposin C was formerly referred to as 'SAP2,' and saposin D was originally called 'component C.' <br>

The biologic effects of PGE2 are mediated through interaction with specific membrane-bound G protein-coupled prostanoid EP receptors. Subtypes of the EP receptor, termed EP1 (PTGER1), EP2 (PTGER2; 176804), EP3 (PTGER3; 176806), and EP4 (PTGER4; 601586), are defined on the basis of their pharmacologic profiles and signal transduction pathways and reviewed by Coleman et al.

The type II enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the free carboxyl groups of D-aspartyl and L-isoaspartyl residues. These methyl-accepting residues result from the spontaneous deamidation, isomerization, and racemization of normal L-aspartyl and L-asparaginyl residues and represent sites of covalent damage to aging proteins PCMT1 (EC 2.1.1.77) is a protein repair enzyme that initiates the conversion of abnormal D-aspartyl and L-isoaspartyl residues to the normal L-aspartyl form. <br>

176875=><br> Protein phosphorylation, a crucial posttranslational modification that controls many diverse cellular functions, is dependent on the opposing actions of protein kinases and protein phosphatases. Protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) is 1 of 4 major protein phosphatases identified in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells that are responsible for the dephosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in proteins. Although all 4 protein phosphatases have overlapping substrate specificities in vitro, they can be distinguished by the use of inhibitor proteins and by their dependence on metal ions. PP1 is inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of 2 thermostable proteins, inhibitor-1 (PPP1R1A; 613246) and inhibitor-2 (PPP1R2; 601792), whereas the other 3 phosphatases (see PPP2CA; 176915) are unaffected by these inhibitors. PPP1CA encodes a catalytic subunit of PP1 that forms heterodimers with various PP1 regulatory subunits (e.g., PPP1R3A; 600917). These regulatory subunits target PP1 to particular subcellular locations and selectively enhance its activity toward certain substrates (Cohen and Cohen, 1989). <br>
176876=><br> The protein-tyrosine phosphatases are a highly pleomorphic set of molecules that have a role in regulating the responses of eukaryotic cells to extracellular signals (Dechert et al., 1995). They achieve this by regulating the phosphotyrosine content of specific intracellular proteins. The PTPases have been grouped by virtue of the characteristic catalytic domain sequence similarities that define this family. Dechert et al. (1995) noted that the noncatalytic domain shows a striking degree of sequence heterogeneity. In general, however, mammalian PTPases can be subdivided into 1 of 2 broad categories: (1) transmembrane receptor PTPases that contain linked cytoplasmic catalytic domains, and (2) intracellular PTPases. Included within the latter category are 2 closely related mammalian intracellular PTPases whose sequences encode 2 tandem SRC homology 2 (SH2) domains that are located at the amino-terminal side of a single PTPase catalytic domain. SH2 domains enable the binding of these SH2 domain-containing PTPases to specific phosphotyrosine residues within protein sequences. The first mammalian SH2 domain-containing PTPase identified was PTP1C (PTPN6; 176883). The second mammalian SH2 domain-containing PTPase identified is encoded by the PTPN11 gene. <br>

PTPases can be divided into 2 classes: small, soluble enzymes containing a single conserved PTPase domain, such as T-cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPT; 176887), and larger, more complex receptor-linked PTPases containing 2 tandem PTPase domains. PTPRA belongs to the latter group, which also includes leukocyte common antigen (LCA, or PTPRC; 151460) and leukocyte antigen-related tyrosine phosphatase (LAR, or PTPRF; 179590) (summary by Kaplan et al.

176911=><br> Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is an essential enzyme in the signaling pathway of the second messenger cAMP. Through phosphorylation of target proteins, PKA controls many biochemical events in the cell including regulation of metabolism, ion transport, and gene transcription. The PKA holoenzyme is composed of 2 regulatory and 2 catalytic subunits and dissociates from the regulatory subunits upon binding of cAMP. <br>
176912=><br> The cAMP-dependent protein kinase system is believed to mediate most, if not all, cellular effects of the second messenger cAMP. The kinase holoenzyme consists of 2 regulatory (R) and 2 catalytic (C) subunits that dissociate upon the binding of 2 cAMP molecules to each of the R subunits. The free, activated C subunits then catalyze the phosphorylation of specific substrate proteins on serine and threonine residues and thereby alter their activity or function. PRKAR2B is 1 of several R subunits (Levy et al., 1988). <br>

176915=><br> Protein phosphorylation, a crucial posttranslational modification step controlling many diverse cellular functions, is dependent on the opposing actions of protein kinases and protein phosphatases. The enzyme protein phosphatase 2A is 1 of 4 major protein phosphatases identified in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells which are responsible for the dephosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in proteins. Although all 4 protein phosphatases, PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C, have overlapping substrate specificities in vitro, they can be distinguished by the use of inhibitor proteins and by their dependence on metal ions. PP1 is inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of 2 thermostable proteins, inhibitor 1 and inhibitor 2, whereas the type 2 phosphatases are unaffected by these inhibitors. The type 2 phosphatases can be distinguished by how their activity is regulated: PP2A activity is independent of metal ions, PP2B is activated by Ca(2+)/calmodulin, and PP2C is activated by Mg(2+) (Cohen and Cohen, 1989). Protein phosphatase 2A appears to play a role in the regulation of most major metabolic pathways, as well as translation, transcription, and control of transition from G2 to the M phase of the cell cycle. PP2A may function as either a tumor promoter or tumor suppressor, depending on the cell type or the transforming agent. The mammalian enzyme can be isolated as a catalytic subunit of 36 kD complexed to 1 regulatory subunit of 65 kD and to another regulatory subunit of varying molecular mass, depending on the tissue and the separation technique used. Two isoforms of the catalytic subunit of PP2A, alpha and beta (176916), are demonstrable in many mammalian species. The structures of these catalytic subunits show the highest evolutionary conservation of all known enzymes, supporting the idea that they may serve crucial functions. <br>

Prothrombin is activated to the serine protease thrombin by factor Xa (F10; 613872) in the presence of phospholipids, calcium, and factor Va (F5; 612309). The activated thrombin enzyme plays an important role in hemostasis and thrombosis: it converts fibrinogen (134820) to fibrin for blood clot formation, stimulates platelet aggregation, and activates coagulation factors V, VIII (F8; 300841), and XIII (F13A1; 134570).

179730=><br> Relaxin is a peptide hormone produced by the corpora lutea of ovaries during pregnancy in many mammalian species, including man. The secretion of the hormone into the blood stream just before parturition results in a marked softening and lengthening of the pubic symphysis and a softening of the cervix, which facilitates the birth process. By inhibiting uterine contractions, relaxin may influence the timing of parturition. Like insulin, relaxin consists of two peptide chains, A and B, covalently linked by disulfide bonds. By further analogy to insulin, the two peptides are synthesized as a single-chain precursor polypeptide with the B chain at the NH2-terminus. <br>

DPEP1 is responsible for hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring of antibiotics, such as penem and carbapenem (Campbell et al., 1984). Earlier, beta-lactamase enzymes were thought to occur only in bacteria, where their probable function was in protecting the organisms against the action of beta-lactam antibiotics.

Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to form angiotensin I (106150), which is converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin I-converting enzyme (106180), an important regulator of blood pressure and electrolyte balance.

In the absence of ligand, DNA-bound RXR/RARA represses transcription by recruiting the corepressors NCOR1 (600849), SMRT (NCOR2; 600848), and histone deacetylase (see 601241). When ligand binds to the complex, it induces a conformational change allowing the recruitment of coactivators, histone acetyltransferases (see 603053), and the basic transcription machinery. Translocations that always involve rearrangement of the RARA gene are a cardinal feature of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; 612376). The most frequent translocation is t(15,17)(q21;q22), which fuses the RARA gene with the PML gene (102578) (Vitoux et al., 2007). <br>

180380=><br> Visual pigments are the light-absorbing molecules that mediate vision. They consist of an apoprotein, opsin, covalently linked to 11-cis-retinal or, rarely, 11-cis-dehydroretinal. Visual pigments are integral membrane proteins that reside in the plasma and disc membranes of the photoreceptor outer segment. When a photon is absorbed by a visual pigment, retinal is isomerized from the 11-cis to the all-trans configuration, triggering conformational changes in the attached apoprotein that create or unveil an enzymatic site on its cytosolic face. An enzymatically active visual pigment catalyzes the conversion of several hundred second messengers from the inert to the active state, the first step in a cascade of enzymatic reactions that ultimately produces a neural signal. Rhodopsin is the visual pigment of photoreceptors with rod-shaped outer segments, or retinal rods.

(1982) found a variant tRNA-i(met) with a G-to-T transversion in the highly conserved TCGA sequence in loop 4, a sequence position occupied exclusively by a purine (usually G) in almost 200 prokaryotic and eukaryotic tRNAs. One functional consequence of this base substitution is reduction in the rate of processing of the primary transcript of the gene. A second, demonstrated by microinjection into the germinal vesicle of the intact Xenopus laevis oocyte, is blockage of egress from the nucleus. It has been estimated that the human haploid genome contains 1,000 to 2,000 tRNA genes and that there are 50 to 60 chromatographically distinct tRNA species. These observations suggest redundancy of some tRNA genes. The studies of initiator methionine tRNA genes bear out this suspicion. <br>

These receptors consist of several main groups subdivided into several distinct subtypes on the basis of their pharmacologic characteristics, coupling to intracellular second messengers, and distribution within the nervous system (Zifa and Fillion, 1992).

182138=><br> Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) is a neurotransmitter in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Following release, 5-HT is actively cleared from synaptic spaces by SLC6A4, a high-affinity, Na(+)- and Cl(-)-dependent transporter localized in presynaptic neuronal membranes. This brain 5-HT transporter appears to be a principal site of action of many tricyclic antidepressants, such as impramine, and may mediate behavioral and/or toxic effects of cocaine and amphetamines. After serotonin release in brain synapses, it is taken up into the presynaptic neuron by SLC6A4, which thus terminates the synaptic actions of serotonin and recycles it into the neurotransmitter pool (summary by Ramamoorthy et al., 1993). <br>

SNRPN also encodes a long alternatively spliced transcript containing several small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and extends downstream to partially overlap the UBE3A gene (601623) in the antisense orientation. The SNRPN gene is transcribed exclusively from the paternally inherited chromosome and shows highest expression in brain and heart. SNRPN is located within an imprinted gene cluster in chromosome 15 that is associated with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS; 176270) and Angelman syndrome (AS; 105830), 2 clinically distinct neurogenetic disorders. PWS arises from loss of function of genes in this region expressed exclusively from the paternal chromosome, suggesting that SNRPN may play a role in its etiology (Rodriguez-Jato et al., 2005). <br>

182305=><br> In cardiac myocytes, Ca(2+) concentrations alternate between high levels during contraction and low levels during relaxation. The increase in Ca(2+) concentration during contraction is primarily due to release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. However, some Ca(2+) also enters the cell through the sarcolemma (plasma membrane). During relaxation, Ca(2+) is sequestered within the intracellular stores. To prevent overloading of intracellular stores, the Ca(2+) that entered across the sarcolemma must be extruded from the cell. The Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger is the primary mechanism by which the Ca(2+) is extruded from the cell during relaxation. In the heart, the exchanger may play a key role in digitalis action. The exchanger is the dominant mechanism in returning the cardiac myocyte to its resting state following excitation. <br>

182530=><br> RAS genes (e.g., 190020) encode membrane-bound guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that function in the transduction of signals that control cell growth and differentiation. Binding of GTP activates RAS proteins, and subsequent hydrolysis of the bound GTP to GDP and phosphate inactivates signaling by these proteins. GTP binding can be catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors for RAS, and GTP hydrolysis can be accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). The first exchange factor to be identified for RAS was the S. cerevisiae CDC25 gene product. Genetic analysis indicated that CDC25 is essential for activation of RAS proteins. In Drosophila, the protein encoded by the 'son of sevenless' gene (Sos) contains a domain that shows sequence similarity with the catalytic domain of CDC25. Sos may act as a positive regulator of RAS by promoting guanine nucleotide exchange. <br>
182590=><br> Spasmolytic protein, initially identified as a contaminant in commercial insulin stocks prepared from porcine pancreatic extracts, is an inhibitor of spasmolytic activity and gastric acid secretion in the pig. Its human homolog exhibits homology to the pS2 protein (TFF1; 113710), an estrogen-dependent breast cancer marker and a member of the trefoil protein family. Trefoil proteins are small secretory proteins characterized by a 40-amino acid trefoil motif that contains 3 conserved disulfide bonds. The 3 intrachain disulfide bonds form the trefoil motif (TFF domain). They serve to maintain or repair the epithelial mucosa, and promote cell migration. They are predominantly found in gastrointestinal tissues, and are upregulated around areas of epithelial damage and in meta- and neoplasia. See also TFF3 (600633). <br>
182600=><br> The hereditary spastic paraplegias are a group of clinically and genetically diverse disorders characterized by progressive, usually severe, lower extremity spasticity; see reviews of Fink et al. (1996) and Fink (1997). <br> SPG is classified according to both the mode of inheritance (autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive (see 270800), and X-linked (see 303350)) and whether progressive spasticity occurs in isolation ('uncomplicated SPG') or with other neurologic abnormalities ('complicated SPG'), including optic neuropathy, retinopathy, extrapyramidal disturbance, dementia, ataxia, ichthyosis, mental retardation, and deafness. The major neuropathologic feature of autosomal dominant, uncomplicated SPG is axonal degeneration that is maximal in the terminal portions of the longest descending and ascending tracts (crossed and uncrossed corticospinal tracts to the legs and fasciculus gracilis, respectively). Spinocerebellar fibers are involved to a lesser extent. Since the description of 'pure' hereditary spastic paraparesis of late onset by Strumpell (1904), many 'complicated' forms of the disorder have been reported and the question as to whether a 'pure' form exists has been raised off and on. Probably in large part because of their exceptional length, the pyramidal tracts are unusually vulnerable to both acquired and genetic derangement. Although a majority of reported families have displayed recessive inheritance, 10 to 30% of families have a dominant pattern and in fact recessive inheritance of a 'pure' spastic paraplegia may be rare. <br> In addition to SPG3A, which is caused by mutation in the SPG3A gene, other forms of autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia caused by mutations in different genes include SPG4 (182601), which is caused by mutation in the SPAST gene (604277) on chromosome 2p22-p21, SPG6 (600363), which is caused by mutation in the NIPA1 gene (608145) on 15q11.1, SPG8 (603563), which is caused by mutation in the KIAA0196 gene (610657) on 8q24, SPG10 (604187), which is caused by mutation in the KIF5A gene (602821) on 12q13, SPG13 (605280), which is caused by mutation in the SSPD1 gene (118190) on 2q33.1, SPG31 (610250), which is caused by mutation in the REEP1 gene (609139) on 2p11.2, and SPG33 (610244), which is caused by mutation in the ZFYVE27 gene (610243) on 10q24.2. <br> Autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia has been mapped to chromosomes 10q (SPG9; 601162), 19q13 (SPG12; 604805), 9q (SPG19; 607152), 1p31-p21 (SPG29; 609727), 12q23-q24 (SPG36; 613096), 8p21.1-q13.3 (SPG37; 611945), 4p16-p15 (SPG38; 612335), and 11p14.1-p11.2 (SPG41; 613364). <br>

Distal HMN is often referred to as a 'neuronopathy' instead of a 'neuropathy' based on the hypothesis that the primary pathologic process resides in the neuron cell body and not in the axons (Irobi et al., 2006). <br> Harding (1993) proposed a classification of distal HMN into 7 phenotypic subtypes according to age at onset, mode of inheritance, and presence of additional features.

186854=><br> Taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid) is a major intracellular amino acid in mammals. It is involved in a number of important physiologic processes, including bile acid conjugation in hepatocytes, modulation of calcium flux and neural excitability, osmoregulation, detoxification, and membrane stabilization. The cells of most organisms respond to hypertonicity by the intracellular accumulation of high concentrations of small organic solutes (osmolytes) that, in contrast to high concentrations of electrolytes, do not perturb the function of macromolecules. The renal medulla is normally the only tissue in mammals that undergoes wide shifts in tonicity. Its hypertonicity when the kidney is excreting a concentrated urine is fundamental to water conservation. The taurine content of the renal medulla of rats infused with 5% NaCl is higher than that in controls, suggesting that taurine behaves as an osmolyte in the renal medulla. Indeed, taurine functions as an osmolyte in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. When MDCK cells cultured in isotonic medium are switched to hypertonic medium, their content of taurine doubles through the taking up of taurine from the medium. Taurine transport in these cells is dependent on sodium and chloride ions and is localized primarily in the basolateral plasma membrane (summary by Uchida et al., 1992). <br>

Approximately 5% of NMTC is hereditary, occurring as a minor component of a familial cancer syndrome (e.g., familial adenomatous polyposis 175100, Carney complex 160980) or as a primary feature (familial NMTC or FNMTC). Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most common histologic subtype of FNMTC, accounting for approximately 85% of cases. <br> Follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) accounts for approximately 15% of NMTC and is defined by invasive features that result in infiltration of blood vessels and/or full penetration of the tumor capsule, in the absence of the nuclear alterations that characterize papillary carcinoma (summary by Bonora et al., 2010). FTC is rarely multifocal and usually does not metastasize to the regional lymph nodes but tends to spread via the bloodstream to the lung and bones. An important histologic variant of FTC is the oncocytic (Hurthle cell, oxyphilic) follicular carcinoma composed of eosinophilic cells replete with mitochondria. <br>

188545=><br> Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH; 613879), a small neuropeptide, is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system as well as in extraneural tissues. The peptide is synthesized in the hypothalamus and transported by the portal vascular system to the anterior pituitary where it acts on thyrotropic and lactotropic cells to promote secretion of TSH and prolactin, respectively. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor that activates the inositol phospholipid-calcium-protein kinase C transduction pathway upon the binding of TRH. The TRHR gene is expressed in the thyrotrope cells of the anterior pituitary. <br>
188550=><br> Nonmedullary thyroid cancer (NMTC) comprises thyroid cancers of follicular cell origin and accounts for more than 95% of all thyroid cancer cases (summary by Vriens et al., 2009). The remaining cancers originate from parafollicular cells (medullary thyroid cancer, MTC; 155240). NMTC is classified into 4 groups: papillary, follicular (188470), Hurthle cell (607464), and anaplastic. Approximately 5% of NMTC is hereditary, occurring as a component of a familial cancer syndrome (e.g., familial adenomatous polyposis 175100, Carney complex 160980) or as a primary feature (familial NMTC or FNMTC). Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most common histologic subtype of FNMTC, accounting for approximately 85% of cases. <br> PTC is characterized by distinctive nuclear alterations including pseudoinclusions, grooves, and chromatin clearing (summary by Bonora et al., 2010). PTCs smaller than 1 cm are referred to as papillary microcarcinomas. These tumors have been identified in up to 35% of individuals at autopsy, suggesting that they may be extremely common although rarely clinically relevant. PTC can also be multifocal but is typically slow-growing with a tendency to spread to lymph nodes and usually has an excellent prognosis. <br>

188580=><br> Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis is a sporadic muscle disorder characterized by episodic attacks of weakness associated with hypokalemia in individuals with hyperthyroidism. The paralysis resolves upon treatment of hyperthyroidism. The disorder is most common among males of Asian descent, including Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Koreans, although it occurs less commonly in individuals of Caucasian background. Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis is clinically similar to hereditary hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HOKPP; 170400), but the paralysis in TTPP occurs only in the presence of hyperthyroidism. TTPP can also be precipitated by factors that result in hypokalemia, such as carbohydrate ingestion and rest after exercise (review by Kung, 2006). <br>

It is inactive in the absence of cAMP. Activation occurs when 2 cAMP molecules bind to each regulatory subunit, eliciting a reversible conformational change that releases active catalytic subunits. Four distinct regulatory subunits of PKA have been identified: RI-alpha, RI-beta (176911), RII-alpha (176910), and RII-beta (176912). Phosphorylation mediated by the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of metabolism, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (review by Bossis and Stratakis, 2004). <br>

R binder proteins are a class of immunologically identical but electrophoretically distinct glycoproteins found in many secretions, such as saliva, gastric juice, tears, milk and leukocytes, and differ only in their carbohydrate content; 'R' denotes 'rapid,' referring to electrophoretic mobility (Azen and Denniston, 1979).

The RAS proteins are GDP/GTP-binding proteins that act as intracellular signal transducers. The most well-studied members of the RAS (derived from 'RAt Sarcoma' virus) gene family include KRAS, HRAS (190020), and NRAS (164790). These genes encode immunologically related proteins with a molecular mass of 21 kD and are homologs of rodent sarcoma virus genes that have transforming abilities. While these wildtype cellular proteins in humans play a vital role in normal tissue signaling, including proliferation, differentiation, and senescence, mutated genes are potent oncogenes that play a role in many human cancers (Weinberg, 1982; Kranenburg, 2005). <br>

190180=><br> TGFB is a multifunctional peptide that controls proliferation, differentiation, and other functions in many cell types. TGFB acts synergistically with TGFA (190170) in inducing transformation. It also acts as a negative autocrine growth factor. Dysregulation of TGFB activation and signaling may result in apoptosis. Many cells synthesize TGFB and almost all of them have specific receptors for this peptide. TGFB1, TGFB2 (190220), and TGFB3 (190230) all function through the same receptor signaling systems. <br>
190181=><br> The TGFBR1 gene encodes a serine/threonine kinase receptor for transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB1; 190180). Most growth factor receptors are transmembrane tyrosine kinases or are associated with cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. Another class of transmembrane receptors, however, is predicted to function as serine/threonine kinases. On the basis of their various biologic activities, different species of TGF-beta are probably potent developmental regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation. Several types of TGF-beta-binding proteins have been detected at the cell surface. Type I and type II receptors are defined on the basis of the mobility of their (125)I-TGF-beta cross-linked products in denaturing gels. These receptors probably mediate most activities of TGF-beta. The type II receptor (TGFBR2; 190182) functions as a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase and is required for the antiproliferative activity of TGF-beta, whereas the type I receptor mediates the induction of several genes involved in cell-matrix interactions (summary by Ebner et al., 1993). <br>

190196=><br> Transglutaminases (EC 2.3.2.13) catalyze the crosslinking of proteins by epsilon-gamma glutamyl lysine isopeptide bonds. The transglutaminases include factor XIII (plasma transglutaminase; 134570), keratinocyte transglutaminase (TGM1; 190195), hair follicle transglutaminase, prostate transglutaminase (TGM4; 600585), and tissue transglutaminase (TGM2). Although the overall primary structures of these enzymes are different, they all share a common amino acid sequence at the active site (YGQCW) and a strict calcium dependence for their activity. Differences in the primary structures of transglutaminases are probably responsible for their diverse biologic functions. The unique C terminus of TGM2, which is not involved in TGase activity, functions as a G protein (see GNAQ; 600998) in receptor signaling. <br>
190197=><br> The pathfinding of axons toward their targets represents an early step in the development of the nervous system. Axonal extension involves selective interactions between molecules on the surface of the axon and those in the local microenvironment. In vitro functional studies of axonal surface glycoproteins suggest that they are involved in cell adhesion and in the promotion of neurite outgrowth. Some of these glycoproteins, including CNTN2, are expressed by restricted subsets of central and peripheral neurons during the initial phase of neurite outgrowth (Dodd et al., 1988; summary by Tsiotra et al., 1993). <br>

The sarcomere, the contractile element in muscle, including the myocardium, is constituted by 7 major proteins and several minor ones organized into thin and thick filaments. Each tropomyosin dimer (TPM1, 191010; TPM2, 190990 ) interacts with 7 actins and is associated with a troponin complex. Each complex is composed of 1 molecule of each of the 3 troponins: T, C, and I. This tropomyosin-troponin complex is responsible for the calcium sensitivity of the contractile apparatus (Nadal-Ginard and Mahdavi, 1989), and thus plays an important role in linking excitation to contraction in skeletal muscle. <br>

191045=><br> The troponin complex is located on the thin filament of striated muscle and is composed of 3 component polypeptides: troponin T (TNNT1, 191041; TNNT2), troponin I (TNNI1, 191042; TNNI2, 191043; TNNI3, 191044), and troponin C (TNNC, 191040; 191039). Three troponin T genes have been described on the basis of molecular cloning in humans and other vertebrates. These are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and encode the troponin T isoforms expressed in cardiac muscle, slow skeletal muscle (TNNT1), and fast skeletal muscle (TNNT3; 600692). Each of these genes is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in the production of multiple tissue-specific isoforms. <br>
191050=><br> Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze the first step of protein synthesis. Human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (YARS; 603623) can be split into 2 fragments having distinct cytokine activities, thereby linking protein synthesis to cytokine signaling pathways. Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS) is a close homolog of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. It catalyzes the aminoacylation of tRNA(trp) with tryptophan, an essential function of the cell's protein synthesis machinery. <br>
191060=><br> Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH; EC 1.14.16.4) catalyzes the biopterin-dependent monooxygenation of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HT), which is subsequently decarboxylated to form the neurotransmitter serotonin. It is thus the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of serotonin. TPH expression is limited to a few specialized tissues: raphe neurons, pinealocytes, mast cells, mononuclear leukocytes, beta-cells of the islets of Langerhans, and intestinal and pancreatic enterochromaffin cells. <br>

191100=><br> Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder characterized by hamartomas in multiple organ systems, including the brain, skin, heart, kidneys, and lung. Central nervous system manifestations include epilepsy, learning difficulties, behavioral problems, and autism. Renal lesions, usually angiomyolipomas, can cause clinical problems secondary to hemorrhage or by compression and replacement of healthy renal tissue, which can cause renal failure. Patients can also develop renal cysts and renal-cell carcinomas. Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis can develop in the lungs. Skin lesions include melanotic macules, facial angiofibromas, and patches of connective tissue nevi. There is a wide clinical spectrum, and some patients may have minimal symptoms with no neurologic disability (reviews by Crino et al., 2006 and Curatolo et al., 2008). <br> Approximately 10 to 30% of cases of tuberous sclerosis are due to mutations in the TSC1 gene: the frequency of cases due to mutations in the TSC2 gene is consistently higher. TSC2 mutations are associated with more severe disease (Crino et al., 2006) (see GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS section). <br>

TNF was originally identified in mouse serum after injection with Mycobacterium bovis strain bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and endotoxin. Serum from such animals was cytotoxic or cytostatic to a number of mouse and human transformed cell lines and produced hemorrhagic necrosis and in some instances complete regression of certain transplanted tumors in mice (Shirai et al., 1985; Pennica et al., 1984). <br>

191170=><br> The transcription factor p53 responds to diverse cellular stresses to regulate target genes that induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, or changes in metabolism. In addition, p53 appears to induce apoptosis through nontranscriptional cytoplasmic processes. In unstressed cells, p53 is kept inactive essentially through the actions of the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (164785), which inhibits p53 transcriptional activity and ubiquitinates p53 to promote its degradation. Numerous posttranslational modifications modulate p53 activity, most notably phosphorylation and acetylation. Several less abundant p53 isoforms also modulate p53 activity. Activity of p53 is ubiquitously lost in human cancer either by mutation of the p53 gene itself or by loss of cell signaling upstream or downstream of p53 (Toledo and Wahl, 2006; Bourdon, 2007; Vousden and Lane, 2007). <br>

HSP90 proteins normally associate with other cochaperones and play important roles in folding newly synthesized proteins or stabilizing and refolding denatured proteins after stress. HSP90B1 is an endoplasmic reticulum HSP90 protein. Other HSP90 proteins are found in cytosol (see HSP90AA1; 140571) and mitochondria (TRAP1; 606219) (Chen et al., 2005). <br>

191315=><br> The NTKR1 gene encodes the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase-1 receptor and belongs to a family of nerve growth factor receptors whose ligands include neurotrophins. Neurotrophins and their receptors play an important role in regulating development of both the central and the peripheral nervous systems. Bothwell (1996), Carter and Lewin (1997), and Bibel and Barde (2000) reviewed neurotrophins and their receptors. Nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR; 162010) is also referred to as p75(NTR) due to its molecular mass and its ability to bind at low affinity not only NGF (see 162020, 162030), but also other neurotrophins, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; 113505), neurotrophin-3 (NTF3; 162660), and neurotrophin-4 (NTF4; 162662). Higher affinity binding of NGFR can achieved by association with higher molecular mass, low-affinity neurotrophin receptors, namely the tropomyosin receptor kinases, TRKA (NTRK1), TRKB (NTRK2; 600456), and TRKC (NTRK3; 191316). TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC are specific for or 'preferred by' NGF, NTF4 and BDNF, and NTF3, respectively (Ip et al., 1993). NTF3 also binds to TRKA and TRKB, but with significantly lower affinity. <br>

191321=><br> Ubiquitin is a small protein of 76 amino acids that is found exclusively in eukaryotes and shows extreme evolutionary conservation. Comparison of ubiquitin sequences from species ranging from yeast to human shows that 71 of the 76 residues are conserved. The human genome contains multiple ubiquitin genes, many of which are nonfunctional reverse-transcribed pseudogenes. The transcriptionally active genes generate mRNAs of approximately 600, 1,000, and 2,500 nucleotides, and these have been termed UBA, UBB (191339), and UBC (191340), respectively. The 600-nucleotide UBA transcripts encode human ubiquitin-ribosomal protein fusion proteins and represent products of the UBA52 gene (Baker and Board, 1991) and the UBA80 gene (191343; Lund et al., 1985). <br>

Complex III consists of 10 nuclear-encoded subunits and 1 mitochondrial-encoded subunit (cytochrome b; 516020). <br>
191339=><br> Ubiquitin, a small protein consisting of 76 amino acids, has been found in all eukaryotic cells studied. It is one of the most conserved proteins known; the amino acid sequence is identical from insects to humans, and there are only 3 substitutions within the plant and yeast sequences. Two classes of ubiquitin genes are recognized. Class I is a polyubiquitin gene, such as UBB or UBC (191340), encoding a polyprotein of tandemly repeated ubiquitins. The class II genes are fusion products between a single ubiquitin gene and 1 of 2 other possible sequences, either 52 or 76 to 80 predominantly basic amino acids (see UBA52, 191321, and UBA80, 191343, respectively). Ubiquitin is required for ATP-dependent, nonlysosomal intracellular protein degradation, which eliminates most intracellular defective problems as well as normal proteins with a rapid turnover. Degradation involves covalent binding of ubiquitin to the protein to be degraded, through isopeptide bonds from the C-terminal glycine residue to the epsilon-amino groups of lysyl side chains. Presumably, the function of ubiquitin is to label the protein for disposal by intracellular proteases. The most abundant ubiquitin-protein conjugate, however, is ubiquitin-H2A, in which ubiquitin is bound to lys119 in histone H2A; this conjugate is not degraded. Since such ubiquitinated histones are present primarily in actively transcribed chromosomal regions, ubiquitin may play a role in regulation of gene expression (summary by Wiborg et al. (1985) and Baker and Board (1987)). <br>
191340=><br> Studies of ubiquitin cDNAs and genes show 2 unusual gene structural arrangements (Schlesinger and Bond, 1987). The first type of arrangement is the polyubiquitin gene, consisting of tandem repeats of a ubiquitin coding unit, with the number of repeats varying considerably even within species. Presumably posttranslational cleavage produces ubiquitin monomers from the primary translation product. The second structural type is the ubiquitin fusion gene, which encodes a single ubiquitin moiety fused to an unrelated tail protein. Three types of ubiquitin have been identified: A, B (191339), and C. The ubiquitin C (UBC) mRNA corresponds to a 9-coding-unit polyubiquitin gene. <br>
191342=><br> UCHL1 is a member of a gene family whose products hydrolyze small C-terminal adducts of ubiquitin to generate the ubiquitin monomer.

UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs, or UDPGTs; EC 2.4.1.17) catalyze the addition of the glycosyl group from a nucleotide sugar to a small hydrophobic molecule (aglycone). UGT1A1 encodes the critically important bilirubin UGT (Ritter et al., 1992). <br> - UGT1A Gene Complex <br> Several UGT1A enzymes, including UGT1A1, are encoded by the UGT1A gene complex on chromosome 2q37. The 5-prime region of the UGT1A complex contains 13 tandemly arrayed first exons, including 4 pseudo exons, that are linked to 4 common exons in the UGT1A 3-prime region. Each first exon has its own promoter element. The 9 viable first exons are independently spliced to the common exons 2 through 5 to generate 9 UGT1A transcripts with unique 5-prime ends and identical 3-prime ends. The N-terminal region encoded by each unique first exon determines acceptor substrate specificity, while the 246-amino acid C-terminal region encoded by the 4 common exons specifies interactions with the common donor substrate, UDP-glucuronic acid (Gong et al., 2001). <br> Each first exon is considered a unique gene linked to the 4 common exons in the UGT1A complex.

192968=><br> The integrin alpha-1 chain associates with the beta-1 chain (ITGB1; 135630) to form a heterodimer that functions as a dual laminin/collagen receptor in neural cells and hematopoietic cells. It has a role in cell attachment and neurite outgrowth on laminin (see 150325) and collagen as well as in peripheral nerve regeneration (Douville et al., 1992). <br>

192975=><br> The integrin family includes cell surface receptors for extracellular matrix components as well as receptors involved in various aspects of leukocyte adhesion. The integrins generally consist of alpha-beta heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins in which the alpha subunit is noncovalently associated with the beta subunit. Three major subfamilies of integrins have been defined, each containing a common beta subunit that can be associated with multiple alpha subunits. Two sets of integrins have been reported on lymphoid and myeloid cells. The first set, including LFA1 (see 153370/600065), Mac1 (120980), and p150,95 (151510), represents the molecules that are exclusively expressed on leukocytes. The second set, the VLA antigens, are not restricted to leukocytes because nearly all of the cell types, except granulocytes and red blood cells, express them. They consist of at least 6 different chains that can associate with the same beta-1 subunit. These complexes are mainly involved in cell-matrix adhesive interactions. Within the VLA family, VLA4 is atypical because it participates not only in extracellular matrix adhesion as receptor for fibronectin (135600) but also as cell-cell adhesion receptor. <br>

193000=><br> Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) make up a family of diseases with a diverse anatomic spectrum, including kidney anomalies (e.g., renal dysplasia, duplex kidney, and hydronephrosis) and ureter anomalies (e.g., vesicoureteral reflux, megaureter, and ureterovesical junction (UVJ) obstruction). See also renal adysplasia (191830). <br> Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), one of the most common manifestations of CAKUT, with an incidence of approximately 1 in 100 infants, is characterized by the reflux of urine from the bladder into the ureters and sometimes into the kidneys, and is a risk factor for urinary tract infections (Lu et al., 2007). Primary VUR results from a developmental defect of the ureterovesical junction (UVJ). In combination with intrarenal reflux, the resulting inflammatory reaction may result in renal injury or scarring, also called reflux nephropathy (RN). Extensive renal scarring impairs renal function and may predispose patients to hypertension, proteinuria, and renal insufficiency. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Vesicoureteral Reflux <br> A locus designated VUR1 maps to chromosome 1p13. VUR2 (610878) is caused by mutation in the ROBO2 gene (602431) on chromosome 3p12.3, and VUR3 (613674) is caused by mutation in the SOX17 gene (610928) on chromosome 8q11.23. A possible X-linked form has been reported (VURX; 314550). <br>

Patients frequently present with bone pain, rickets, and tooth abscesses. In contrast to X-linked dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH; 307800), ADHR shows incomplete penetrance, variable age at onset (childhood to adult), and resolution of the phosphate-wasting defect in rare cases (Econs et al., 1997). <br> See also hypophosphatemic bone disease (146350). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Hypophosphatemic Rickets <br> Other forms of hypophosphatemic rickets include an autosomal recessive forms, i.e., ARHR1 (241520), caused by mutation in the DMP1 gene (600980) on chromosome 4q21, and ARHR2 (613312), caused by mutation in the ENPP1 gene (173335) on chromosome 6q22-q23. An X-linked dominant form (307800) is caused by mutation in the PHEX gene (300550), and an X-linked recessive form (300554) is caused by mutation in the CLCN5 gene (300008). <br> - Clinical Variability of Hypophosphatemic Rickets <br> Hypophosphatemic rickets can be caused by disorders of vitamin D metabolism or action (see VDDR1A, 264700). A form of hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH; 241530) is caused by mutation in the SLC34A3 gene (609826), and there is evidence that a form of hypophosphatemic rickets with hyperparathyroidism (612089) may be caused by a translocation that results in an increase in alpha-klotho levels (KLOTHO; 604824). <br>

Brauch et al. (1995) further subdivided VHL type 2 into type 2A (with pheochromocytoma) and type 2B (with pheochromocytoma and renal cell carcinoma). Hoffman et al. (2001) noted that VHL type 2C refers to patients with isolated pheochromocytoma without hemangioblastoma or renal cell carcinoma. McNeill et al. (2009) proposed that patients with VHL syndrome caused by large VHL deletions that include the HSPC300 gene (C3ORF10; 611183) have a specific subtype of VHL syndrome characterized by protection from renal cell carcinoma, which the authors proposed be named VHL type 1B. <br> Nordstrom-O'Brien et al. (2010) provided a review of the genetics of von Hippel-Lindau disease. <br>
193400=><br> Von Willebrand disease is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. It is characterized clinically by mucocutaneous bleeding, such as epistaxis and menorrhagia, and prolonged bleeding after surgery or trauma. The disorder results from a defect in platelet aggregation due to defects in the von Willebrand factor protein. Von Willebrand factor is a large, multimeric protein that plays a role in platelet adhesion and also serves as a carrier for the thrombotic protein factor VIII (F8; 300841). F8 is mutated in hemophilia A (review by Goodeve, 2010). <br> - Classification of von Willebrand Disease  <br> The classification of von Willebrand disease has a long and complex history. The current classification is based on that described by Sadler (1994) and updated by Sadler et al. (2006), which delineates 3 main subtypes according to the mutant protein phenotype. An earlier classification developed by a working party of the European Thrombosis Research Organization was provided by Zimmerman and Ruggeri (1983). <br> Von Willebrand Disease Type 1 <br> VWD type 1 is a quantitative partial deficiency of circulating VWF. In this type of VWD, there is a normal ratio of functional VWF activity (VWF:RCo, ristocetin cofactor activity) relative to VWF antigen level (VWF:Ag) (Sadler et al., 2006, Goodeve, 2010). Mannucci (2004) stated that type 1 VWD accounts for 60 to 80% of all VWD cases and is characterized by mild to moderate quantitative deficiencies of VWF and factor VIII, which are coordinately reduced to 5 to 30% of normal plasma levels (pathogenic levels of 5 to 30 IU/dL). In an updated consensus statement, Sadler et al. (2006) noted that (1) some cases of VWF type 1 may have subtle abnormal VWF multimer patterns, but still retain normal functional activity, and (2) that loci other than VWF may be responsible for some cases of VWD. <br> In reviews, James and Lillicrap (2008) and Lillicrap (2009) stated that the knowledge of the pathogenesis and molecular basis of type 1 VWD is still in its infancy and still evolving. Population studies have indicated that type 1 VWD is a complex genetic trait associated with a variety of genetic and environmental factors, and that additional loci in addition to VWF are likely involved. There is still uncertainty about the pathogenicity of many identified putative VWF variants, and the incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity of type 1 disease contributes to complexity in diagnosis and understanding of disease pathogenesis. <br> Von Willebrand Disease Type 2 <br> VWD type 2 (613554), which accounts for 10 to 30% of cases, is characterized by qualitative abnormalities of VWF; it is further divided into subtypes 2A, 2B, 2M, and 2N. The mutant VWF protein in types 2A, 2B, and 2M are defective in their platelet-dependent function, whereas the mutant protein in type 2N is defective in its ability to bind F8 (Mannucci, 2004; Sadler et al., 2006; Goodeve, 2010). <br> Von Willebrand Disease Type 3 <br> VWD type 3 (277480), which accounts for 1 to 5% of cases, is characterized by a severe quantitative defect of VWF in plasma (less than 1% of normal plasma levels), with low but usually detectable levels of factor VIII (1 to 10% of normal plasma levels). In the rare type 3 disease (1 in 1 million people), symptoms are more frequent and severe (Mannucci, 2004, Sadler et al., 2006). <br>

201910=><br> Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) results from a deficiency in one or another of the enzymes of cortisol biosynthesis. In about 95% of cases, 21-hydroxylation is impaired in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex so that 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) is not converted to 11-deoxycortisol. Because of defective cortisol synthesis, ACTH levels increase, resulting in overproduction and accumulation of cortisol precursors, particularly 17-OHP, proximal to the block. This causes excessive production of androgens, resulting in virilization. <br> Slominski et al. (1996) presented evidence that the CYP21A2, CYP11A1 (118485), CYP17 (609300), and ACTHR (202200) genes are expressed in skin (see 202200). The authors suggested that expression of these genes may play a role in skin physiology and pathology and that cutaneous proopiomelanocortin activity may be autoregulated by a feedback mechanism involving glucocorticoids synthesized locally. <br>
202010=><br> Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of corticosteroid biosynthesis resulting in androgen excess, virilization, and hypertension. The defect causes decreased synthesis of cortisol and corticosterone in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal gland, resulting in accumulation of the precursors 11-deoxycortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone; the latter is a potent salt-retaining mineralocorticoid that leads to arterial hypertension (White et al., 1991). <br> CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency accounts for approximately 5 to 8% of all CAH cases; approximately 90% of cases are caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency (201910) (White et al., 1991). <br>

Moreover, the adrenal response to ACTH is severely impaired. There is no mineralocorticoid deficiency and the renin-angiotensin system is not affected. This entity is in most cases inherited as an autosomal recessive. Patients with mutations in the MC2R gene are classified as having GCCD1. However, more than half of patients do not have mutations in the MC2R gene, although they exhibit a nearly indistinguishable phenotype (Genin et al., 2002). <br>

About 60% of affected individuals of European and Middle Eastern ancestry have dominant ELANE mutations, resulting in a form of severe congenital neutropenia, which is designated here as SCN1. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Severe Congenital Neutropenia  <br> Severe congenital neutropenia is a genetically heterogeneous disorder showing autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked inheritance. Autosomal dominant SCN2 (613107) is caused by mutation in the protooncogene GFI1 (600871) on chromosome 1p22. Autosomal recessive SCN3 (610738) is caused by mutation in the HAX1 gene (605998) on 1q21.3, and autosomal recessive SCN4 (612541) is caused by mutation in the G6PC3 gene (611045) on 17q21.

203100=><br> Oculocutaneous albinism is a genetically heterogeneous congenital disorder characterized by decreased or absent pigmentation in the hair, skin, and eyes. The term 'albinism' includes specific ocular changes that are the results of reduced amounts of melanin in the developing eye; these abnormalities in the eye and optic system are specific and necessary for the diagnosis. Aside from decreased pigment in the iris and retina, optic changes include decreased visual acuity, misrouting of the optic nerves at the chiasm, and nystagmus (King et al., 2001). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Oculocutaneous Albinism <br> OCA1, caused by mutations in the TYR gene, is divided clinically into 2 types: type IA, OCA1A, characterized by complete lack of tyrosinase activity due to production of an inactive enzyme, and type IB (OCA1B; 606952), characterized by reduced activity of tyrosinase. OCA2 (203200), OCA3 (203290), and OCA4 (606574) are somewhat milder forms of the disorder, caused by mutations in the OCA2 (611409), TYRP1 (115501), and MATP genes (SLC45A2; 606202), respectively. <br> See also ocular albinism (OA1; 300500), which is restricted phenotypically to ocular involvement only. <br> Although OCA caused by mutations in the TYR gene was classically known as 'tyrosinase-negative' OCA, Tripathi et al. (1992) noted that some patients with 'tyrosinase-positive' OCA may indeed have TYR mutations resulting in residual enzyme activity. These patients can be classified as having OCA1B. <br>
203200=><br> Tyrosinase-positive oculocutaneous albinism (OCA, type II) is an autosomal recessive disorder in which the biosynthesis of melanin pigment is reduced in skin, hair, and eyes. Although affected infants may appear at birth to have OCA type I, or complete absence of melanin pigment, most patients with OCA type II acquire small amounts of pigment with age. Individuals with OCA type II have the characteristic visual anomalies associated with albinism, including decreased acuity and nystagmus, which are usually less severe than in OCA type I (Lee et al,. 1994; King et al., 2001). <br> OCA type II has a highly variable phenotype. The hair of affected individuals may turn darker with age, and pigmented nevi or freckles may be seen. African and African American individuals may have yellow hair and blue-gray or hazel irides. One phenotypic variant, 'brown OCA,' has been described in African and African American populations and is characterized by light brown hair and skin color and gray to tan irides. The hair and irides may turn darker with time and the skin may tan with sun exposure; the ocular features of albinism are present in all variants (King et al., 2001). In addition, previous reports of so-called 'autosomal recessive ocular albinism,' (see, e.g., Witkop et al., 1978 and O'Donnell et al., 1978) with little or no obvious skin involvement, are now considered most likely to be part of the phenotypic spectrum of OCA1 or OCA2 (Lee et al., 1994; King et al., 2001). <br>

203400=><br> CMO type I deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in the penultimate biochemical step of aldosterone biosynthesis, the 18-hydroxylation of corticosterone (B) to 18-hydroxycorticosterone (18-OHB). This enzymatic defect results in decreased aldosterone and salt-wasting. In CMO I deficiency, aldosterone is undetectable, whereas its immediate precursor, 18-OHB, is low or normal. These patients have an increased ratio of corticosterone to 18-OHB (Portrat-Doyen et al., 1998). <br> The CYP11B2 gene product also catalyzes the final step in aldosterone biosynthesis: the 18-oxidation of 18-OHB to aldosterone. A defect in that enzymatic step results in CMO type II deficiency (610600), an allelic disorder with an overlapping phenotype but distinct biochemical features. In CMO II deficiency, aldosterone can be low or normal, but at the expense of increased secretion of 18-OHB. These patients have a low ratio of corticosterone to 18-OHB (Portrat-Doyen et al., 1998). <br>
203450=><br> In decreasing order of frequency, 3 forms of Alexander disease are recognized, based on age of onset: infantile, juvenile, and adult. Younger patients typically present with seizures, megalencephaly, developmental delay, and spasticity. In older patients, bulbar or pseudobulbar symptoms predominate, frequently accompanied by spasticity. The disease is progressive, with most patients dying within 10 years of onset. Imaging studies of the brain typically show cerebral white matter abnormalities, preferentially affecting the frontal region (Gorospe et al., 2002). All 3 forms have been shown to be caused by mutations in the GFAP gene. <br>

Chromosomal breakage is a feature. AT cells are abnormally sensitive to killing by ionizing radiation (IR), and abnormally resistant to inhibition of DNA synthesis by ionizing radiation. The latter trait has been used to identify complementation groups for the classic form of the disease (Jaspers et al., 1988). At least 4 of these (A, C, D, and E) map to chromosome 11q23 (Sanal et al., 1990) and are associated with mutations in the ATM gene. <br>

209850=><br> Autism, the prototypic pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), is usually apparent by 3 years of age. It is characterized by a triad of limited or absent verbal communication, a lack of reciprocal social interaction or responsiveness, and restricted, stereotypical, and ritualized patterns of interests and behavior (Bailey et al., 1996; Risch et al., 1999). 'Autism spectrum disorder,' sometimes referred to as ASD, is a broader phenotype encompassing the less severe disorders Asperger syndrome (see ASPG1; 608638) and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). 'Broad autism phenotype' includes individuals with some symptoms of autism, but who do not meet the full criteria for autism or other disorders. Mental retardation coexists in approximately two-thirds of individuals with ASD, except for Asperger syndrome, in which mental retardation is conspicuously absent (Jones et al., 2008). Genetic studies in autism often include family members with these less stringent diagnoses (Schellenberg et al., 2006). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Autism <br> Autism is considered to be a complex multifactorial disorder involving many genes. Accordingly, several loci have been identified, some or all of which may contribute to the phenotype. Included in this entry is AUTS1, which has been mapped to chromosome 7q22. <br> Other susceptibility loci include AUTS3 (608049), which maps to chromosome 13q14; AUTS4 (608636), which maps to chromosome 15q11; AUTS5 (606053), which maps to chromosome 2q; AUTS6 (609378), which maps to chromosome 17q11; AUTS7 (610676), which maps to chromosome 17q21; AUTS8 (607373), which maps to chromosome 3q25-q27; AUTS9 (611015), which maps to chromosome 7q31; AUTS10 (611016), which maps to chromosome 7q36; AUTS11 (610836), which maps to chromosome 1q41; AUTS12 (610838), which maps to chromosome 21p13-q11; AUTS13 (610908), which maps to chromosome 12q14; AUTS14 (611913), which maps to chromosome 16p11.2; AUTS15 (612100), associated with mutation in the CNTNAP2 gene (604569) on chromosome 7q35-q36; AUTS16 (613410), associated with mutation in the SLC9A9 gene (608396) on chromosome 3q24; and AUTS17 (613436), associated with mutation in the SHANK2 gene (603290) on chromosome 11q13. (NOTE: the symbol 'AUTS2' has been used to refer to a gene on chromosome 7q11 (KIAA0442; 607270) and therefore is not used as a part of this autism locus series.) <br> There are 4 X-linked forms of autism susceptibility: AUTSX1 (300425), associated with mutations in the NLGN3 gene (300336); AUTSX2 (300495), associated with mutations in NLGN4 (300427); AUTSX3 (300496), associated with mutations in MECP2 (300005); and AUTSX4 (300830), associated with variation in the region on chromosome Xp22.11 containing the PTCHD1 gene (300828). <br> Folstein and Rosen-Sheidley (2001) reviewed the genetics of autism. <br>
209880=><br> Idiopathic congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, also known as 'Ondine's curse' (Deonna et al., 1974), is a rare disorder characterized by abnormal control of respiration in the absence of neuromuscular, lung or cardiac disease, or an identifiable brainstem lesion. Patients breathe normally while awake, but hypoventilate with normal respiratory rates and shallow breathing during sleep; more severely affected patients hypoventilate both awake and asleep. These patients typically present in the first hours of life with cyanosis and increased carbon dioxide during sleep. A deficiency in autonomic control of respiration results in inadequate or negligible ventilatory and arousal responses to hypercapnia and hypoxemia (reviewed by Weese-Mayer et al., 1999). <br> Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome has been associated with several disorders classified as neurocristopathies, that is, aberrant phenotypes arising from a defect of migration or differentiation of neural crest cells. These include neuroblastoma (Haddad et al., 1978), ganglioneuroma (Swaminathan et al., 1989), and most frequently Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) which appears in 16% of CCHS patients. The association of CCHS and HSCR is referred to as Haddad syndrome. <br> Congenital central hypoventilation can be a feature of other developmental disorders, such as those caused by mutation in the MECP2 gene (300005). <br>

211530=><br> Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive neurologic disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and a variety of cranial nerve palsies, usually involving the motor components of the seventh and ninth to twelfth (more rarely the third, fifth, and sixth) cranial nerves. Spinal motor nerves and, less commonly, upper motor neurons are sometimes affected, giving a picture resembling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; 105400). The onset of the disease is usually in the second decade, but earlier and later onset have been reported. Hearing loss tends to precede the onset of neurological signs, mostly progressive muscle weakness causing respiratory compromise. However, patients with very early onset may present with bulbar palsy and may not develop hearing loss until later. The symptoms, severity, and disease duration are variable (summary by Green et al., 2010). <br>

PFIC1 and PFIC2 are associated with mildly elevated or normal serum levels of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT1; 612346), whereas PFIC3 is associated with high serum GGT1 levels and liver histology that shows portal inflammation and ductular proliferation in an early stage (Maggiore et al., 1987, 1991). <br> There are also several phenotypically similar liver disorders that result from congenital defects in bile acid synthesis.

211900=><br> Hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by the progressive deposition of basic calcium phosphate crystals in periarticular spaces, soft tissues, and sometimes bone (Chefetz et al., 2005). The biochemical hallmark of tumoral calcinosis is hyperphosphatemia caused by increased renal absorption of phosphate due to loss-of-function mutations in the FGF23 or GALNT3 gene. The term 'hyperostosis-hyperphosphatemia syndrome' is sometimes used when the disorder is characterized by involvement of the long bones associated with the radiographic findings of periosteal reaction and cortical hyperostosis. Although some have distinguished HHS from FTC by the presence of bone involvement and the absence of skin involvement (Frishberg et al., 2005), Ichikawa et al. (2010) concluded that the 2 entities represent a continuous spectrum of the same disease, best described as familial hyperphosphatemic tumoral calcinosis. <br> HFTC is considered to be the clinical converse of autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR; 193100), an allelic disorder caused by gain-of-function mutations in the FGF23 gene and associated with hypophosphatemia and decreased renal phosphate absorption (Chefetz et al., 2005; Ichikawa et al., 2005). <br>

The 2 major forms of lung cancer are nonsmall cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer (see 182280), which account for 85% and 15% of all lung cancers, respectively. Nonsmall cell lung cancer can be divided into 3 major histologic subtypes: squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell lung cancer. Cigarette smoking causes all types of lung cancer, but it is most strongly linked with small cell lung cancer and squamous cell carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is the most common type in patients who have never smoked. Nonsmall cell lung cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and has a poor prognosis (Herbst et al., 2008). <br>

212065=><br> Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) are a genetically heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders caused by enzymatic defects in the synthesis and processing of asparagine (N)-linked glycans or oligosaccharides on glycoproteins. These glycoconjugates play critical roles in metabolism, cell recognition and adhesion, cell migration, protease resistance, host defense, and antigenicity, among others. CDGs are divided into 2 main groups: type I CDGs comprise defects in the assembly of the dolichol lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) chain and its transfer to the nascent protein, whereas type II CDGs (see, e.g., CDG2A, 212066) refer to defects in the trimming and processing of the protein-bound glycans either late in the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi compartments. CDG1A is the most common form of CDG and was the first to be characterized at the molecular level (reviews by Marquardt and Denecke, 2003; Grunewald et al., 2002). <br> Matthijs et al. (1997) noted that Jaeken syndrome (CDG1A) is a genetic multisystem disorder characterized by defective glycosylation of glycoconjugates. It usually presents as a severe disorder in the neonatal period. There is a severe encephalopathy with axial hypotonia, abnormal eye movement, and pronounced psychomotor retardation, as well as peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar hypoplasia, and retinitis pigmentosa. Patients show a peculiar distribution of subcutaneous fat, nipple retraction, and hypogonadism. There is a 20% lethality in the first year of life due to severe infections, liver insufficiency, or cardiomyopathy. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type I <br> Multiple forms of CDG type I have been identified; see CDG1B (602579) through CDG1Q (612379). <br>

The biochemical changes of CDGs are most readily observed in serum transferrin (TF; 190000), and the diagnosis is usually made by isoelectric focusing of this glycoprotein (reviews by Marquardt and Denecke, 2003; Grunewald et al., 2002). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type II <br> Multiple forms of CDG type II have been identified; see CDG2B (606056) through CDG2J (613489). <br>

Clinical features include neurologic abnormalities, cardiomyopathy and arrythmias, skeletal muscle damage, and liver dysfunction. Most patients become symptomatic in the neonatal period with a rapidly progressive deterioration and a high mortality rate. However, presentations at a later age with a milder phenotype have been reported (summary by Rubio-Gozalbo et al., 2004). <br>

The disorder is associated with a neurodegenerative phenotype that begins between 30 and 50 years of age. The changes seen in IBGC occur in the absence of calcium or parathyroid hormone (PTH; 168450) metabolic disorders, such as hypoparathyroidism (see 146200) or pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP; see 103580). <br> See also IBGC2 (606656).

In addition, calcification of the basal ganglia is observed as an incidental finding in approximately 0.7 to 1.2% of CT scans (Koller et al., 1979; Harrington et al., 1981; Forstl et al., 1992). These incidental calcifications are usually benign and have no clear etiology, especially in patients over 60 years of age (Geschwind et al, 1999). Forstl et al.

Large deposits of cholesterol and cholestanol are found in virtually every tissue, particularly the Achilles tendons, brain, and lungs. Cholestanol, the 5-alpha-dihydro derivative of cholesterol, is enriched relative to cholesterol in all tissues. The diagnosis can be made by demonstrating cholestanol in abnormal amounts in the serum and tendon of persons suspected of being affected. Plasma cholesterol concentrations are low normal in CTX patients. <br> Dotti et al. (2001) examined the ophthalmologic findings of 13 CTX patients. In addition to cataracts, which were found in all cases, optic disc pallor was identified in 6 of the patients.

The fourth group, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP; 215100), is a distinct PBD phenotype and in nearly all instances results from mutations in the PEX7 gene (601757) (Moser et al., 1995; Wanders, 2004). <br> See also (601539) for a discussion of patients with a peroxisomal biogenesis disorder who do not fall into these phenotypic groups. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Zellweger Syndrome  <br> Zellweger syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous disorder and can be caused by mutation in any one of several genes involved in peroxisome biogenesis, including peroxin-1 (PEX1; 602136) on chromosome 7q21, peroxin-2 (PEX2; 170993) on 8q21, peroxin-3 (PEX3; 603164) on 6q23-q24, peroxin-5 (PEX5; 600414) on 12p13, peroxin-6 (PEX6; 601498) on 6p21, peroxin-7 (PEX7; 601757) on 6q22-q24, peroxin-10 (PEX10; 602859) on 1p36, peroxin-12 (PEX12; 601758) on chromosome 17, peroxin-13 (PEX13; 601789) on 2p15, peroxin-14 (PEX14; 601791) on 1p36, peroxin-16 (PEX16; 603360) on 11p12, peroxin-19 (PEX19; 600279) on 1q22, and peroxin-26 (PEX26; 608666) on 22q11. The 'PEX' genes encode proteins essential for the assembly of functional peroxisomes (Distel et al., 1996). <br> In addition to the defects in peroxisome assembly, Distel et al. (1996) noted that peroxisomal disorders include a number of single peroxisomal enzyme deficiencies: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD; 300100), acyl-coenzyme A oxidase deficiency (264470), DHAPAT deficiency (222765), alkyl-DHAP synthase deficiency (600121), glutaric aciduria type III (231690), classic Refsum disease (266500), hyperoxaluria type I (259900), and acatalasia (115500). <br>

The clinical triad consists of short neck, low posterior hairline, and limited neck movement, although less than 50% of patients demonstrate all 3 clinical features (Tracy et al., 2004). <br> Clarke et al.

Several different subtypes of autosomal recessive demyelinating CMT have been identified, each with particular ethnic, pathologic, or clinical characteristics: CMT4A; CMT4B, which includes CMT4B1 (601382) and CMT4B2 (604563); CMT4C (601596); CMT4D (601455); CMT4E (605253); CMT4F (145900), which is likely a form of Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS); CMT4G, or Russe-type hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, (605285); and CMT4H (609311). <br>
214450=><br> Griscelli syndrome type 1 (GS1) represents hypomelanosis with a primary neurologic deficit and without immunologic impairment or manifestations of hemophagocytic syndrome (Menasche et al., 2002). Griscelli syndrome with immune impairment, or Griscelli syndrome type 2 (607624), is caused by mutation in the RAB27A gene (603868). Griscelli syndrome type 3 (609227), characterized by hypomelanosis with no immunologic or neurologic manifestations, can be caused by mutation in the melanophilin (MLPH; 606526) or MYO5A genes. <br> Griscelli syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that results in pigmentary dilution of the skin and hair, the presence of large clumps of pigment in hair shafts, and an accumulation of melanosomes in melanocytes. While most patients also develop hemophagocytic syndrome, leading to death in the absence of bone marrow transplantation (Menasche et al., 2000), some show severe neurologic impairment early in life without apparent immune abnormalities. Bahadoran et al. (2003) characterized GS1 as comprising hypomelanosis and severe central nervous system dysfunction, corresponding to the 'dilute' phenotype in the mouse, and GS2 as comprising hypomelanosis and lymphohistiocytotic hemophagocytosis, corresponding to the 'ashen' phenotype in mouse. <br> Anikster et al. (2002), Menasche et al. (2002), Huizing et al. (2002), and Bahadoran et al. (2003, 2003) suggested that Elejalde syndrome (256710) in some patients and GS1 represent the same entity. <br>

216360=><br> COACH syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by mental retardation, ataxia due to cerebellar hypoplasia, and hepatic fibrosis. Other features, such as coloboma and renal cysts, may be variable. COACH syndrome is considered by some to be a subtype of Joubert syndrome (JBTS; 213300) with congenital hepatic fibrosis. Identification of liver disease in these patients is critical because some may develop complications such as portal hypertension with fatal variceal bleeding (Brancati et al., 2008; Doherty et al., 2010). <br>
216400=><br> Cockayne syndrome is characterized by abnormal and slow growth and development that becomes evident within the first few years after birth. 'Cachectic dwarfism' describes the outward appearance of afflicted individuals. Other features include cutaneous photosensitivity, thin, dry hair, a progeroid appearance, progressive pigmentary retinopathy, sensorineural hearing loss, dental caries, and a characteristic stance in the ambulatory patient. Patients often show disproportionately long limbs with large hands and feet, and flexion contractures of joints are usual skeletal features. Knee contractures result in a 'horse-riding stance.' There is delayed neural development and severe progressive neurologic degeneration resulting in mental retardation. The mean age at death in reported cases is 12.5 years, although a few affected individuals have lived into their late teens or twenties. Remarkably, in striking contrast with xeroderma pigmentosum, patients with CS have no significant increase in skin cancer or infection (Nance and Berry, 1992). <br> Lowry (1982) noted that there is an early-onset form of Cockayne syndrome in which patients may show abnormalities at birth and have a shorter survival. Lowry (1982) thus suggested that CS could be divided clinically into the more common type I, with classic CS symptoms that manifest within the first few years or life, and the less common type II, with more severe symptoms that manifest prenatally. Mallery et al. (1998) found no correlation between genotype and phenotype among 16 patients with CS of varying severities, and concluded that clinical differences were based on other genetic backgrounds or the intrauterine environment. <br>

217030=><br> The CFI gene encodes complement factor I ('eye'), a serine proteinase in the complement pathway responsible for cleaving and inactivating the activities of C4b (120820) and C3b (see 120700). Factor I is a plasma glycoprotein composed of 2 polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bonds. Both the light and heavy chains of factor I are encoded by the CFI gene (Catterall et al., 1987). The light chain contains the serine protease domain (Vyse et al., 1994). <br>
217050=><br> The final consequence of complement activation is formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), a multiprotein assembly that perforates cell membranes, forming transmembrane channels. C6 is 1 of 5 late-acting proteins of complement that participate in assembly and function of the MAC (DiScipio and Hugli, 1989). <br>
217070=><br> C7 is a single-chain plasma glycoprotein involved in the cytolytic phase of complement activation (Hobart et al., 1995).

217090=><br> Congenital plasminogen deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized clinically by chronic muscosal pseudomembranous lesions consisting of subepithelial fibrin deposition and inflammation. The most common clinical manifestation is ligneous ('wood-like') conjunctivitis, a redness and subsequent formation of pseudomembranes mostly on the palpebral surfaces of the eye that progress to white, yellow-white, or red thick masses with a wood-like consistency that replace the normal mucosa. The lesions may be triggered by local injury and/or infection and often recur after local excision. Pseudomembranous lesions of other mucous membranes often occur in the mouth, nasopharynx, trachea, and female genital tract. Some affected children also have congenital occlusive hydrocephalus. A slightly increased female:male ratio has been observed (1.4:1 to 2:1) (Schuster and Seregard, 2003; Tefs et al., 2006). <br> Type I plasminogen deficiency is characterized by decreased serum plasminogen activity, decreased plasminogen antigen levels, and clinical symptoms, whereas type II plasminogen deficiency, also known as 'dysplasminogenemia,' is characterized by decreased plasminogen activity with normal or slightly reduced antigen levels. Patients with type II deficiency are usually asymptomatic. Ligneous conjunctivitis and pseudomembranous formation has only been associated with type I plasminogen deficiency. Presumably, normal amounts of plasminogen antigen with decreased activity, as seen in type II, is sufficient for normal wound healing (Schuster and Seregard, 2003). <br>

217990=><br> The corpus callosum is the largest fiber tract in the central nervous system and the major interhemispheric fiber bundle in the brain. Formation of the corpus callosum begins as early as 6 weeks' gestation, with the first fibers crossing the midline at 11 to 12 weeks' gestation, and completion of the basic shape by age 18 to 20 weeks (Schell-Apacik et al., 2008). Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is one of the most frequent malformations in brain with a reported incidence ranging between 0.5 and 70 in 10,000 births. ACC is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition, which can be observed either as an isolated condition or as a manifestation in the context of a congenital syndrome (see MOLECULAR GENETICS and Dobyns, 1996). <br> Schell-Apacik et al.

Although some familial cases have been reported, the vast majority of AIMAH cases are sporadic. Patients typically present in the fifth and sixth decades of life, approximately 10 years later than most patients with other causes of Cushing syndrome (Swain et al., 1998; Christopoulos et al., 2005). <br> Approximately 10 to 15% of adrenal Cushing syndrome is due to primary bilateral ACTH-independent adrenocortical pathology. The 2 main subtypes are AIMAH and primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD, see 610489), which is often a component of the Carney complex (160980) and associated with mutations in the PRKAR1A gene (188830) on chromosome 17q23-q24. AIMAH is rare, representing less than 1% of endogenous causes of Cushing syndrome (Swain et al., 1998; Christopoulos et al., 2005). <br> Cushing 'disease' (219090) is an ACTH-dependent disorder caused in most cases by pituitary adenomas that secrete excessive ACTH. <br>

219800=><br> Cystinosis has been classified as a lysosomal storage disorder on the basis of cytologic and other evidence pointing to the intralysosomal localization of stored cystine. Cystinosis differs from the other lysosomal diseases inasmuch as acid hydrolysis, the principal enzyme function of lysosomes, is not known to play a role in the metabolic disposition of cystine. The fact that plasma levels are well below saturation indicates that the defect is a cellular one. Within the cell, cystine is compartmentalized with acid phosphatase and is membrane-bound as demonstrated by electron microscopy. Ferritin accumulates in the same organelle which appears to be the lysosome. <br>

220100=><br> Cystinuria, one of the 4 inborn errors of metabolism discussed by Garrod (1908), is a heritable disorder of amino acid transport, transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. Calonge et al. (1995) noted that it is one of the most common genetic disorders, with an overall prevalence of approximately 1 in 7,000. It is due to the defective transport of cystine and dibasic amino acids through the epithelial cells of the renal tubule and intestinal tract. Cystine has a low solubility, and its precipitation results in the formation of calculi in the urinary tract, which leads to obstruction, infections, and ultimately renal insufficiency. <br>

See 123995 for discussion of some of the nuclear-encoded subunits. <br> Shoubridge (2001) provided a comprehensive review of cytochrome c oxidase deficiency and noted that most isolated COX deficiencies are inherited as autosomal recessive disorders caused by mutations in nuclear-encoded genes; mutations in the mtDNA-encoded COX subunit genes are relatively rare. <br>

222448=><br> The faciooculoacousticorenal (FOAR) syndrome was first described as comprising facial anomalies, ocular anomalies, sensorineural hearing loss, and proteinuria. Facial features include prominent brow, short nose, and hypertelorism, and ocular anomalies include myopia, iris hypoplasia, and/or retinal detachment (Regenbogen and Coscas, 1985). Donnai-Barrow syndrome (DBS) was first described as a distinct disorder characterized by diaphragmatic hernia, exomphalos, absent corpus callosum, myopia, and sensorineural deafness. The classic distinguishing features between the 2 disorders were presence of proteinuria and absence of diaphragmatic hernia and corpus callosum anomalies in FOAR (Donnai and Barrow, 1993). However, early reports noted that the 2 disorders shared many phenotypic features and may be identical (e.g., Devriendt et al., 1998). Although there is variability in the expression of some features (e.g., agenesis of the corpus callosum and proteinuria), the disorders are now considered to represent the same entity (Kantarci et al., 2007). <br>

223100=><br> In humans, the activities of lactase and most of the other digestive hydrolases are maximal at birth. The majority of the world's human population experiences a decline in production of the digestive enzyme lactase-phlorizin hydrolase during maturation, with the age of onset ranging from the toddler years to young adulthood. Due to the reduced lactase level, lactose present in dairy products cannot be digested in the small intestine and instead is fermented by bacteria in the distal ileum and colon. The fermentative products result in symptoms of diarrhea, gas bloat, flatulence, and abdominal pain. However, in a minority of adults, high levels of lactase activity persist in adulthood. Lactase persistence is a heritable autosomal dominant condition that results in a sustained ability to digest the milk sugar lactose throughout adulthood (Olds and Sibley, 2003). <br>

It is occasionally associated with bone abnormalities, especially of the hands and feet (acrodysostosis), nail hypoplasia, and scoliosis (Tamary et al., 2005). Striking morphologic abnormalities of erythroblasts, reviewed by Wickramasinghe and Wood (2005), include the 'Swiss-cheese' abnormality of erythroblasts on electron microscopy. <br> - Classification and Genetic Heterogeneity of Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia <br> There are 4 types of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia: CDAN2 (224100), caused by mutation in the SEC23B gene (610512); CDAN3 (105600), which maps to chromosome 15q21; and CDAN4 (613673), caused by mutation in the KLF1 gene (600599). <br> All forms of CDAN are characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and multinuclear erythroblasts. The classification of the first 3 types is based on that described by Wendt and Heimpel (1967). Type I is characterized by megaloblastic changes. The more common type II (224100) is characterized by normocytic binuclear or multinuclear red cells, which on electron microscopy contain double cytoplasmic membranes. Type III (105600), which is autosomal dominant, shows prominent erythroblastic multinuclearity forming 'gigantoblasts' with up to 12 nuclei. Type IV (613673) is the designation given to a form of CDA with characteristics different from those of types I, II, and III (Wickramasinghe et al., 1991; Arnaud et al., 2010). <br>

AGS is phenotypically similar to in utero viral infection. Severe neurologic dysfunction becomes clinically apparent in infancy, and manifests as progressive microcephaly, spasticity, dystonic posturing, profound psychomotor retardation, and often death in early childhood. Outside the nervous system, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated hepatic transaminases along with intermittent fever may also erroneously suggest an infective process (Crow et al., 2006). <br> In a review of AGS, Stephenson (2008) noted that an expanded phenotypic spectrum has been recognized, and that the most of the original criteria for diagnosis no longer apply: affected individuals may show later onset, and may not have severe or progressive neurological dysfunction, calcification of the basal ganglia, or CSF lymphocytosis. Importantly, appearance of chilblain is important clinical sign for correct diagnosis. The most severe neonatal form of AGS is typically due to mutation in the TREX1 gene. <br> Cree encephalitis was originally considered a separate disorder, but genetic evidence has shown that it is the same as AGS1. See also pseudo-TORCH syndrome (251290), which shows phenotypic overlap and may in some cases represent AGS (Crow et al., 2000; Crow et al., 2003). <br> AGS is distinct from the similarly named Aicardi syndrome (304050), which is characterized by agenesis of the corpus callosum, spinal skeletal abnormalities, and chorioretinal abnormalities. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome  <br> See also AGS2 (610181), caused by mutation in the gene encoding subunit B of ribonuclease H2 (RNASEH2B; 610326) on chromosome 13q; AGS3 (610329), caused by mutation in the RNASEH2C gene (610330) on chromosome 11q13.2; AGS4 (610333), caused by mutation in the RNASEH2A gene (606034) on chromosome 19p13.13; and AGS5 (612952), caused by mutation in the SAMHD1 gene (606754) on chromosome 20. <br>

However, in subsequent reports of consensus conferences, Fine et al. (2000, 2008) eliminated the term 'hemidesmosomal' because it added undue confusion. The disorder is considered to be a form of junctional EB because skin cleavage occurs within the lamina lucida. Hemidesmosome may be abnormal because the integrins span this region. <br> In a study involving 265 cases of junctional or hemidesmosomal EB, Varki et al.

227220=><br> Pigmentation of hair, eye, and skin is among the most visible examples of human phenotypic variation, with a broad normal range that is subject to substantial geographic stratification. Pigmentation in human tissues is attributable to the number, type, and cellular distribution of melanosomes (subcellular compartments produced by melanocytes that synthesize and store the light-absorbing polymer melanin) (Sulem et al., 2007). Variation in pigmentation among individuals is thought to be caused by biochemical differences that affect the number of melanosomes produced, the type of melanin synthesized (either black-brown eumelanin or red-yellow pheomelanin), and the size and shape of the melanosomes. The key physiologic role of skin pigmentation seems to be to absorb ultraviolet radiation (UVR). This protective role must be weighted against the reduced amount of UVR available for the synthesis of vitamin D3. It is generally believed that the geographic distribution of human skin pigmentation reflects a history of adaptation to latitude-dependent levels of UVR, with individuals tending to have lighter pigmentation with increasing distance from the equator (Relethford, 1997). The majority of variation in human eye and hair color is found among individuals of European ancestry, with most other human populations fixed for brown eyes and black hair (Sulem et al., 2007). Stokowski et al. (2007) cited studies suggesting that the genetic factors influencing lighter pigmentation in Europeans may be far different from the mechanism for lighter pigmentation in East Asians (Relethford, 1997; Norton et al., 2006; Myles et al., 2007). Given the direct correlation between skin pigmentation and incident UV exposure, it has long been postulated that it is a trait under intense selective pressure (Stokowski et al., 2007). Pigmentary mutants in model organisms and human disorders of pigmentation have been the main source for the discovery of genes involved in skin color. More than 100 pigmentation genes have been identified in mouse alone, most with identified human orthologs, and at least 18 genes had been implicated in human albinism. <br>

229300=><br> Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive gait and limb ataxia with associated limb muscle weakness, absent lower limb reflexes, extensor plantar responses, dysarthria, and decreased vibratory sense and proprioception. Onset is usually in the first or second decade, before the end of puberty. It is one of the most common forms of autosomal recessive ataxia, occurring in about 1 in 50,000 individuals. Other variable features include visual defects, scoliosis, pes cavus, and cardiomyopathy (review by Delatycki et al., 2000). <br> Pandolfo (2008) provided an overview of Friedreich ataxia, including pathogenesis, mutation mechanisms, and genotype/phenotype correlation. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Friedreich Ataxia <br> Another locus for Friedreich ataxia has been mapped to chromosome 9p (FRDA2; 601992). <br>

Clinical features include angiokeratoma, progressive psychomotor retardation, neurologic signs, coarse facial features, and dysostosis multiplex. <br> Fucosidosis has been classified into 2 major types. Type 1 is characterized by rapid psychomotor regression and severe neurologic deterioration beginning at about 6 months of age, elevated sweat sodium chloride, and death within the first decade of life. Type 2 is characterized by milder psychomotor retardation and neurologic signs, the development of angiokeratoma corporis diffusum, normal sweat salinity, and longer survival (Kousseff et al., 1976). <br>
230200=><br> Galactokinase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder which causes cataract formation in children not maintained on a lactose-free diet. Cataract formation is the result of osmotic phenomena caused by the accumulation of galactitol in the lens (Asada et al., 1999). <br>

230350=><br> Epimerase-deficiency galactosemia was originally described as a benign condition in which GALE impairment is restricted to circulating red and white blood cells (Gitzelmann, 1972). Fibroblasts, liver, phytohemagglutinin-stimulated leukocyes, and Epstein Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts from these patients all demonstrated normal or near-normal levels of GALE, leading to the designation 'peripheral' (or 'isolated') epimerase deficiency. A second form of epimerase deficiency became apparent in which a patient, despite normal GALT activity, presented with symptoms reminiscent of classic galactosemia and demonstrated severely impaired GALE activity in both red blood cells and fibroblasts (Holton et al., 1981). This form was designated 'generalized' epimerase deficiency. Openo et al. (2006) demonstrated that epimerase deficiency is in fact not a binary condition but is, rather, a continuum disorder. <br> GALE encodes the third enzyme in the Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism. Galactosemia I is classic galactosemia (230400), caused by deficiency of the second enzyme in the Leloir pathway, galactose-1-phosphate uridylyl-transferase (GALT; 606999). Galactosemia II (230200) is caused by deficiency of the first enzyme in the Leloir pathway, galactokinase (GALK; 604313). <br>

All except gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase deficiency are accompanied by hemolytic anemia (Larsson and Anderson, 2001). <br>
230500=><br> GM1-Gangliosidosis is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease characterized by accumulation of ganglioside substrates in lysosomes. Clinically, patients show variable degrees of neurodegeneration and skeletal abnormalities. There are 3 main clinical variants categorized by severity and variable residual beta-galactosidase activity. Type I, or infantile form, shows rapid psychomotor deterioration beginning within 6 months of birth, generalized central nervous system involvement, hepatosplenomegaly, facial dysmorphism, macular cherry-red spots, skeletal dysplasia, and early death. Type II, or late-infantile/juvenile form (230600), has onset between 7 months and 3 years, shows generalized central nervous system involvement with psychomotor deterioration, seizures, localized skeletal involvement, and survival into childhood. Hepatosplenomegaly and cherry-red spots are usually not present. Type III, or adult/chronic form (230650), shows onset from 3 to 30 years and is characterized by localized skeletal involvement and localized central nervous system involvement, such as dystonia or gait or speech disturbance. There is an inverse correlation between disease severity and residual enzyme activity (Suzuki et al., 2001). <br> See also Morquio B disease (253010), an allelic disorder with skeletal anomalies and no neurologic involvement. <br> The GM2-gangliosidoses include Tay-Sachs disease (272800) and Sandhoff disease (268800). <br>
230600=><br> GM1-gangliosidosis type II is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease characterized by slowly progressive generalized neurodegeneration and mild skeletal changes, with onset between 7 months and 3 years of age. Unlike the severe infantile type I, type II is usually not associated with macular cherry-red spots or organomegaly. Within type II, those with somewhat earlier onset and earlier death are considered to have the 'late-infantile' form, whereas those with slightly later onset and survival into late childhood are referred to as having the 'juvenile' form (Caciotti et al., 2003). However, there is no strict age marker to distinguish between these 2 type II forms. GLB1 enzyme activity in type II ranges from approximately 1 to 4% of control values (Nishimoto et al., 1991; Yoshida et al., 1991). <br>
230650=><br> GM1-gangliosidosis type III is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by neurodegeneration and mild skeletal changes. Age at onset ranges from 3 to 30 years. The disorder is less severe than GM1-gangliosidosis types I and II (230600). Type III shows extreme clinical variability, with some patients having only focal neurologic signs, such as dystonia, and others having more severe involvement with extrapyramidal signs and mental retardation. GLB1 enzymatic activity usually ranges from approximately 4 to 10% of control values (Suzuki et al., 2001). <br>

230750=><br> Gastroschisis is a congenital defect of the abdominal wall that occurs laterally to, and often to the right of, a normally closed umbilical ring. Visceral organs that herniate through the defect are not covered by a membrane. Gastroschisis is distinct from omphalocele (164750), which is characterized by herniation of abdominal contents through the base of the umbilical cord; in omphalocele, the visceral organs are covered by membranes (summary by Mastroiacovo et al., 2007). <br> Both omphalocele and gastroschisis, when they occur without other malformations, are probably multifactorial (Baird and MacDonald, 1981). <br>
230800=><br> Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder due to deficient activity of beta-glucocerebrosidase. As a result of this deficiency, there is intracellular accumulation of glucosylceramide (GlcCer, glucosylcerebroside) primarily within cells of mononuclear phagocyte origin, which are the characteristic 'Gaucher cells' identified in most tissues (Jmoudiak and Futerman, 2005). <br> Gaucher disease is classically categorized phenotypically into 3 main subtypes: nonneuronopathic type I, acute neuronopathic type II (230900), and subacute neuronopathic type III (231000). Type I is the most common form of Gaucher disease and lacks primary central nervous system involvement. Types II and III have central nervous system involvement and neurologic manifestations (Knudson and Kaplan, 1962; Jmoudiak and Futerman, 2005). <br> All 3 forms of Gaucher disease are caused by mutation in the GBA gene. There are 2 additional phenotypes which may be distinguished: perinatal lethal Gaucher disease (608013), which is a severe form of type II, and Gaucher disease type IIIC (231005), which also has cardiovascular calcifications. <br> See also 610539 for a form of atypical Gaucher disease caused by mutation in the gene encoding saposin C (PSAP; 176801), which is an activator of beta-glucosidase. <br>

In addition, there is marked siderosis of extrahepatic tissues, including the heart and pancreas (Driscoll et al., 1988). <br> Whitington (2007) postulated that some cases of neonatal hemochromatosis result from maternal alloimmunity directed at the fetal liver, and therefore do not represent an inherited mendelian disorder. Other causes may result from metabolic disease or perinatal infection. In particular, he commented that the disorder is not related to the family of inherited liver diseases that fall under the classification of hereditary hemochromatosis (see, e.g., 235200). Whitington (2007) proposed the term 'congenital alloimmune hepatitis.' <br> In the past, the disorder has loosely been labeled 'neonatal hepatitis' and 'giant cell hepatitis,' which are pathologic findings in the liver representing a common response to a variety of insults, including cholestatic disorders and infection, among others (Fawaz et al., 1975; Knisely et al., 1987; Kelly et al., 2001). <br>

231675=><br> Electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) exists in the mitochondrial matrix as a heterodimer of 30-kD alpha subunits (ETFA; 608053) and 28-kD beta subunits (ETFB; 130410) and contains 1 flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and 1 adenosine 5-prime monophosphate (AMP) per heterodimer. ETFDH, a 64-kD monomer integrated in the inner mitochondrial membrane, contains 1 molecule of FAD and a 4Fe-4S cluster. Both enzymes are required for electron transfer from at least 9 mitochondrial flavin-containing dehydrogenases to the main respiratory chain. Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenation deficiency (MADD; 231680), also known as glutaric aciduria II, can be caused by mutation in any of the 3 ETF genes. The disorders resulting from defects in the ETFA, ETFB, and ETFDH genes are referred to as glutaric aciduria IIA, IIB, and IIC, respectively, although there appears to be no difference in the clinical phenotypes. <br>
231680=><br> Glutaric aciduria II (GA II) is an autosomal recessively inherited disorder of fatty acid, amino acid, and choline metabolism. It differs from GA I (231670) in that multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiencies result in large excretion not only of glutaric acid, but also of lactic, ethylmalonic, butyric, isobutyric, 2-methyl-butyric, and isovaleric acids. GA II results from deficiency of any 1 of 3 molecules: the alpha (ETFA) and beta (ETFB) subunits of electron transfer flavoprotein, and electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETFDH). The clinical picture of GA II due to the different defects appears to be nondistinguishable; each defect can lead to a range of mild or severe cases, depending presumably on the location and nature of the intragenic lesion, i.e., mutation, in each case (Goodman, 1993; Olsen et al., 2003). Clearly, there is much heterogeneity in the group of multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenation disorders (Amendt and Rhead, 1986). <br> Importantly, riboflavin treatment has been shown to ameliorate the symptoms and metabolic profiles in many MADD patients, particularly those with type III, the late-onset and mildest form (Liang et al., 2009). <br>

232330=>
232400=><br> Glycogen storage disease III is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by deficiency of the glycogen debrancher enzyme and associated with an accumulation of abnormal glycogen with short outer chains. Most patients are enzyme-deficient in both liver and muscle (IIIa), but about 15% are enzyme-deficient in liver only (IIIb) (Shen et al., 1996). These subtypes have been explained by differences in tissue expression of the deficient enzyme (Endo et al., 2006). In rare cases, selective loss of only 1 of the 2 debranching activities, glucosidase or transferase, results in type IIIc or IIId, respectively. (Van Hoof and Hers, 1967; Ding et al., 1990). <br> Clinically, patients with GSD III present in infancy or early childhood with hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, and growth retardation.

234200=><br> Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by progressive iron accumulation in the basal ganglia and other regions of the brain, resulting in extrapyramidal movements, such as parkinsonism and dystonia. Age at onset, severity, and cognitive involvement are variable (review by Gregory et al., 2009). <br> PKAN has been classified clinically as 'classic,' 'atypical,' or 'intermediate.' In the classic form, patients present within the first decade of life with rapidly progressing disease and loss of ambulation approximately 15 years later. In the atypical form, patients have onset in the second decade with slow progression and maintain independent ambulation after 15 years. In the intermediate form, patients have early onset and slow progression or later onset and rapid progression. Patients with early onset tend to develop pigmentary retinopathy, whereas those with later onset tend to have speech disorders and psychiatric features. All patients have the 'eye of the tiger' sign on brain MRI (Hayflick et al., 2003; Pellecchia et al., 2005). <br> Kumar et al.

The term 'hemihyperplasia' has replaced the term 'hemihypertrophy' to describe accurately the increase in cell number found in these patients. The incidence of isolated hemihyperplasia is estimated to be 1 in 86,000. Idiopathic hemihypertrophy is associated with increased risk of embryonal cancers in childhood, particularly Wilms tumor (194070) (Shuman et al., 2006). <br> Hoyme et al. (1998) provided an anatomic classification of hemihyperplasia: complex hemihyperplasia is involvement of half of the body, including at least 1 arm and 1 leg; affected parts may be contralateral or ipsilateral. Simple hemihyperplasia is involvement of a single limb. See also facial hemihyperplasia (133900). <br> Although isolated hemihyperplasia is a distinct clinical entity, it can also occur as a feature of overgrowth syndromes, including Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS; 130650), neurofibromatosis (NF1; 162200), Proteus syndrome (176920), and Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome (149000) (Shuman et al., 2006). <br>
235200=><br> Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism wherein the body accumulates excess iron (summary by Feder et al., 1996). Excess iron is deposited in a variety of organs leading to their failure, and resulting in serious illnesses including cirrhosis, hepatomas, diabetes, cardiomyopathy, arthritis, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Severe effects of the disease usually do not appear until after decades of progressive iron loading. Removal of excess iron by therapeutic phlebotomy decreases morbidity and mortality if instituted early in the course of the disease. Classic hemochromatosis (HFE) is most often caused by mutation in a gene designated HFE on chromosome 6p21.3. <br> Adams and Barton (2007) reviewed the clinical features, pathophysiology, and management of hemochromatosis. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Hemochromatosis <br> At least 4 additional iron overload disorders labeled hemochromatosis have been identified on the basis of clinical, biochemical, and genetic characteristics. Juvenile hemochromatosis, or hemochromatosis type 2 (HFE2), is autosomal recessive and is divided into 2 forms: HFE2A (602390), caused by mutation in the HJV gene (608374) on chromosome 1q21, and HFE2B (613313), caused by mutation in the HAMP gene (606464) on chromosome 19q13. Hemochromatosis type 3 (HFE3; 604250), an autosomal recessive disorder, is caused by mutation in the TFR2 gene (604720) on chromosome 7q22. Hemochromatosis type 4 (HFE4; 606069), an autosomal dominant disorder, is caused by mutation in the SLC40A1 gene (604653) on chromosome 2q32. <br>

The vast majority of cases (90%) are sporadic, occur in children under 3 years of age, and are associated with epidemics of diarrhea caused by verotoxin-producing E. coli. The death rate is very low, about 30% of cases have renal sequelae, and there is usually no relapse of the disease. This form of HUS usually presents with a diarrhea prodrome (thus referred to as D+HUS) and has a good prognosis in most cases. <br> In contrast, a subgroup of patients with HUS have an atypical presentation (aHUS or D-HUS) without a prodrome of enterocolitis and diarrhea and have a much poorer prognosis, with a tendency to relapse and frequent development of end-stage renal failure or death. These cases tend to be familial. Both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant inheritance have been reported (Goodship et al., 1997; Taylor, 2001; Veyradier et al., 2003; Noris et al., 2003). Atypical HUS is a genetically heterogeneous condition. Susceptibility to the development of the disorder can be conferred by mutations in various components of or regulatory factors in the complement cascade system (Jozsi et al., 2008).

236100=><br> Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is the most common structural malformation of the human forebrain and occurs after failed or abbreviated midline cleavage of the developing brain during the third and fourth weeks of gestation. HPE occurs in up to 1 in 250 gestations, but only 1 in 8,000 live births (Lacbawan et al., 2009). Classically, 3 degrees of severity defined by the extent of brain malformation have been described. In the most severe form, 'alobar HPE,' there is a single ventricle and no interhemispheric fissure. The olfactory bulbs and tracts and the corpus callosum are typically absent. In 'semilobar HPE,' the most common type of HPE in neonates who survive, there is partial cortical separation with rudimentary cerebral hemispheres and a single ventricle. In 'lobar HPE,' the ventricles are separated, but there is incomplete frontal cortical separation (Corsello et al., 1990). An additional milder form, called 'middle interhemispheric variant' (MIHV) has also been delineated, in which the posterior frontal and parietal lobes are incompletely separated and the corpus callosum may be hypoplastic (Lacbawan et al., 2009). <br> Cohen (2001) discussed problems in the definition of holoprosencephaly, which can be viewed from 2 different perspectives: anatomic (fixed) and genetic (broad). When the main interest is description, the anatomic perspective is appropriate. In genetic perspective, a fixed definition of holoprosencephaly is not appropriate because the same mutational cause may result in either holoprosencephaly or some microform of holoprosencephaly. Cohen (2001) concluded that both fixed and broad definitions are equally valid and depend on context. <br> Munke (1989) provided an extensive review of the etiology and pathogenesis of holoprosencephaly, emphasizing heterogeneity. <br> See also schizencephaly (269160), which may be part of the phenotypic spectrum of HPE. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Holoprosencephaly <br> Several loci for holoprosencephaly have been mapped to specific chromosomal sites and the molecular defects in some cases of HPE have been identified. Holoprosencephaly-1 (HPE1) maps to chromosome 21q22.3. HPE2 (157170), caused by mutation in the SIX3 gene (603714), maps to 2p21. HPE3 (142945), caused by mutation in the Sonic hedgehog gene (SHH; 600725), maps to 7q36. HPE4 (142946), caused by mutation in the TGIF gene (602630), maps to 18p11.3. HPE5 (609637), caused by mutation in the ZIC2 gene (603073), maps to 13q32. HPE6 (605934) maps to 2q37.1. HPE7 (610828), caused by mutation in the PTCH1 gene (601309), maps to 9q22.3. HPE8 (609408) maps to 14q13. HPE9 (610829), caused by mutation in the GLI2 gene (165230), maps to 2q14. HPE10 (612530) maps to 1q41-q42. <br> Wallis and Muenke (2000) gave an overview of mutations in holoprosencephaly. They indicated that at least 12 different loci had been associated with HPE. <br>

236200=><br> Classic homocystinuria is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder of sulfur metabolism. The clinical features of untreated homocystinuria due to CBS deficiency usually manifest in the first or second decade of life and include myopia, ectopia lentis, mental retardation, skeletal anomalies resembling Marfan syndrome (MFS; 154700), and thromboembolic events. Light skin and hair can also be present. Biochemical features include increased urinary homocystine and methionine. There are 2 main phenotypes of the classic disorder: a milder pyridoxine (vitamin B6)-responsive form, and a more severe pyridoxine-nonresponsive form. Pyridoxine is a cofactor for the CBS enzyme, and can aid in the conversion of homocysteine to cysteine (reviewed by Reish et al., 1995 and Testai and Gorelick, 2010). <br> Some patients have been reported to have a milder form of homocystinuria, which is characterized by increased plasma homocysteine and increased risk for thrombotic events in young adulthood, but without the other skeletal, ocular, or nervous system manifestations observed in classic homocystinuria (Kelly et al., 2003). <br>

The phenotype commonly includes cobblestone (type II) lissencephaly, cerebellar malformations, and retinal malformations. More variable features include macrocephaly or microcephaly, hypoplasia of midline brain structures, ventricular dilatation, microphthalmia, cleft lip/palate, and congenital contractures (Dobyns et al., 1989). Those with a more severe phenotype characterized as Walker-Warburg syndrome often die within the first year of life, whereas those characterized as having muscle-eye-brain disease may rarely acquire the ability to walk and to speak a few words. These are part of a group of disorders resulting from defective glycosylation of DAG1 (128239), collectively known as 'dystroglycanopathies' (Godfrey et al., 2007). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Congenital Muscular Dystrophy-Dystroglycanopathy with Brain and Eye Anomalies (Type A) <br> Muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy with brain and eye anomalies (type A) is genetically heterogeneous and can be caused by mutation in other genes involved in DAG1 glycosylation: see MDDGA2 (613150), caused by mutation in the POMT2 gene (607439), MDDGA3 (253280), caused by mutation in the POMGNT1 gene (606822), MDDGA4 (253800), caused by mutation in the FKTN gene (607440), MDDGA5 (613153), caused by mutation in the FKRP gene (606596), and MDDGA6 (613154), caused by mutation in the LARGE gene (603590). <br>

Affected individuals usually present prenatally or in early childhood with grossly distorted renal tracts, comprising dysmorphic bladders and dilatation of the ureter and renal pelvis. They are at high risk of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), with ascending bacterial infection leading to kidney damage, hypertension, and renal failure. One-third of UFS children also experience constipation or fecal soiling, suggesting that the pathophysiology of the syndrome encompasses a broader functional impairment of elimination. In addition, affected individuals have a characteristic facial grimace when trying to smile (summary by Daly et al., 2010). <br>

There are 2 main forms: a lethal neonatal type and a less severe, delayed-onset type (summary by Klaus et al., 2009). <br> Urea cycle disorders are characterized by the triad of hyperammonemia, encephalopathy, and respiratory alkalosis. Five disorders involving different defects in the biosynthesis of the enzymes of the urea cycle have been described: ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (311250), carbamyl phosphate synthetase deficiency, argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency, or citrullinemia (215700), argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (207900), and arginase deficiency (207800). <br>

238320=><br> Leydig cell hypoplasia is an autosomal recessive disorder in which loss of function of the LHCGR gene in the male prevents normal sexual development. Two types of LCH have been defined (Toledo, 1992). Type I, a severe form caused by complete inactivation of LHCGR, is characterized by complete 46,XY male pseudohermaphroditism, low testosterone and high LH levels, total lack of responsiveness to LH/CG challenge, lack of breast development, and absent development of secondary male sex characteristics. Type II, a milder form caused by partial inactivation of the gene, displays a broader range of phenotypic expression ranging from micropenis to severe hypospadias. Females with inactivating mutations in the LHCGR gene display a mild phenotype characterized by defective follicular development and ovulation, amenorrhea, and infertility (review by Themmen and Huhtaniemi, 2000). <br>

There is bilateral ectropion and eclabium, and the nose and ears are flattened and appear rudimentary. Constricting bands around the extremities can restrict movement and cause digital necrosis. As the skin barrier is severely compromised, neonates are more prone to sepsis, dehydration, and impaired thermoregulation. Treatment with oral retinoids encourages shedding of the grossly thickened skin.

Kartagener (pronounced KART-agayner) syndrome is characterized by the combination of primary ciliary dyskinesia and situs inversus (270100), and occurs in approximately half of patients with ciliary dyskinesia. Since normal nodal ciliary movement in the embryo is required for normal visceral asymmetry, absence of normal ciliary movement results in a lack of definitive patterning; thus, random chance alone appears to determine whether the viscera take up the normal or reversed left-right position during embryogenesis. This explains why approximately 50% of patients, even within the same family, have situs inversus (Afzelius, 1976; El Zein et al., 2003). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia <br> Other forms of primary ciliary dyskinesia include CILD2 (606763) on chromosome 19q13.3-qter; CILD3 (608644), caused by mutation in the DNAH5 gene (603335) on 5p; CILD4 (608646) on 15q13; CILD5 (608647) on 16p12; CILD6 (610852), caused by mutation in the TXNDC3 gene (607421) on 7p14-p13; CILD7 (611884), caused by mutation in the DNAH11 gene (603339) on 7p21; CILD8 (612274) on 15q24-q25; CILD9 (612444), caused by mutation in the DNAI2 gene (605483) on 17q25; CILD10 (612518), caused by mutation in the KTU gene (612517) on 14q21.3; CILD11 (612649), caused by mutation in the RSPH4A gene (612647) on 6q22; CILD12 (612650), caused by mutation in the RSPH9 gene (612648) on 6p21; CILD13 (613193), caused by mutation in the LRRC50 gene (613190) on 16q24.1; CILD14 (613807), caused by mutation in the CCDC39 gene (613798) gene on 3q26.33; CILD15 (613808), caused by mutation in the CCDC40 gene (613799) on 17q25.3, and CILD16 (614017), caused by mutation in the DNAL1 gene (610062) on 14q24.3. <br> Ciliary abnormalities have also been reported in association with both X-linked and autosomal forms of retinitis pigmentosa.

Leukotriene C4 and its receptor-binding metabolites LTD4 and LTE4 are cysteinyl leukotrienes that are potent lipid mediators of tissue inflammation. In general, leukotrienes are potent proinflammatory mediators synthesized from membrane-derived arachidonic acid after activation of certain granulocytes (Kanaoka et al., 2001). <br> The cysteinyl leukotrienes have been implicated in bronchial asthma. CYSLTR1 (300201) and CYSLTR2 (605666) are receptors for LTC4 and its metabolites. CYSLTR-selective pharmacologic antagonists are important in the treatment of asthma (Martinez Molina et al., 2007). <br>

247200=><br> Features of the Miller-Dieker syndrome include classic lissencephaly (pachygyria, incomplete or absent gyration of the cerebrum), microcephaly, wrinkled skin over the glabella and frontal suture, prominent occiput, narrow forehead, downward slanting palpebral fissures, small nose and chin, cardiac malformations, hypoplastic male extrenal genitalia, growth retardation, and mental deficiency with seizures and EEG abnormalities. Life expectancy is grossly reduced, with death most often occurring during early childhood (summary by Schinzel, 1988). <br> Lissencephaly means 'smooth brain,' i.e., brain without convolutions or gyri. <br> Deletion of or mutation in the LIS1 gene (PAFAH1B1; 601545) appears to cause the lissencephaly because point mutations have been identified in this gene in isolated lissencephaly sequence (ILS; see 607432). Facial dysmorphism and other anomalies in Miller-Dieker patients appear to be the consequence of deletion of additional genes distal to LIS1. Toyo-oka et al. (2003) presented evidence that the gene whose deletion is responsible for the greater severity of Miller-Dieker syndrome compared to isolated lissencephaly is the gene encoding 14-3-3-epsilon (YWHAE; 605066). <br>

There is no obvious associated clinical or hematologic pathology, and all patients have been identified through identification of anti-Lu3 antibodies in their serum (Karamatic Crew et al., 2007). <br> The Lutheran inhibitor blood group phenotype (In(Lu); 111150) is characterized phenotypically by the apparent absence of the Lu antigen on red blood cells during serologic tests, i.e. Lu(a-b-). Since it is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, it was initially postulated to result from an inhibitor of the Lu antigen. However, Singleton et al. (2008) found that the phenotype results from a mutation in the transcription factor KLF1 that regulates expression of the BCAM gene. These 2 forms of Lutheran absence on red blood cells can be differentiated both by the pedigree and by serologic studies. <br> An X-linked recessive form (309050) has been rarely reported. <br>

In type I, the defect affects the soluble form of the enzyme, is restricted to red blood cells, and causes well-tolerated methemoglobinemia. In type II, the defect affects both the soluble and microsomal forms of the enzyme and is thus generalized, affecting red cells, leukocytes, and all body tissues. Type II methemoglobinemia is associated with mental deficiency and other neurologic symptoms. The neurologic symptoms may be related to the major role played by the cytochrome b5 system in the desaturation of fatty acids (Vives-Corrons et al., 1978; Kaplan et al., 1979). <br>

Type I has very high levels of the 2 metabolites in urine, impaired speech development, and autosomal recessive inheritance. Type II (Barth syndrome) is X-linked and has mitochondrial cardiomyopathy, short stature, skeletal myopathy, and recurrent infections; cognitive development is normal. Type III occurs in Iraqi Jews and involves optic atrophy, movement disorder, and spastic paraplegia. In types II and III, the elevations of 3-methylglutaconate and 3-methylglutarate in urine are modest. The designation type IV has been used for 3-methylglutaconic aciduria occurring in association with severe psychomotor retardation and cerebellar dysgenesis. Type V MGA is characterized by early-onset dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects, nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia, testicular dysgenesis, and growth failure in addition to 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (Chitayat et al., 1992; Davey et al., 2006). <br> Eriguchi et al.

251200=><br> Primary microcephaly refers to the clinical finding of a head circumference less than 3 standard deviations (SD) below the age- and sex-related mean, present at birth. Primary microcephaly is a static developmental anomaly, distinguished from secondary microcephaly, which refers to a progressive neurodegenerative condition. Microcephaly is a disorder of fetal brain growth; individuals with microcephaly have small brains and almost always have mental retardation, although rare individuals with mild microcephaly (-3 SD) and normal intelligence have been reported. Additional clinical features may include short stature or mild seizures. MCPH is associated with a simplification of the cerebral cortical gyral pattern and a slight reduction in the volume of the white matter, consistent with the small size of the brain, but the architecture of the brain in general is normal, with no evidence of a neuronal migration defect (review by Woods et al., 2005). <br> Most cases of primary microcephaly show an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Because MCPH directly affects neurogenesis, or neurogenic mitosis, rather than growth of the skull, some prefer the term 'micrencephaly' (Hofman, 1984). <br> MCPH1 in particular is associated with premature chromosome condensation in cell studies (Darvish et al., 2010). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Primary Microcephaly <br> Primary microcephaly is a genetically heterogenous disorder.

Two forms are recognized: early-onset MVID with diarrhea beginning in the neonatal period, and late-onset, with first symptoms appearing after 3 or 4 months of life. Definite diagnosis is made by transmission electron microscopy demonstrating shortening or absence of apical microvilli with pathognomonic microvillus inclusions in mature enterocytes and peripheral accumulation of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive granules or vesicles in immature enterocytes (Muller et al., 2008).

Furthermore, monosomy 7 or 7q- is the most frequent abnormality of karyotype in cases of AML that occur after cytotoxic cancer therapy or occupational exposure to mutagens. The age distribution of de novo cases shows peaks in the first and fifth decades. Monosomy 7 is found in about 5% of de novo and 40% of secondary cases of AML.

The lysosomal hydrolases in ML IV are normal, in contrast to most other storage diseases. The disorder results from a defect in transport along the lysosomal pathway, affecting membrane sorting and/or late steps of endocytosis, which causes intracellular accumulation of lysosomal substrates.

252900=><br> The Sanfilippo syndrome, or mucopolysaccharidosis III, is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease due to impaired degradation of heparan sulfate (Esposito et al, 2000). The disorder is characterized by severe central nervous system degeneration, but only mild somatic disease. Onset of clinical features usually occurs between 2 and 6 years; severe neurologic degeneration occurs in most patients between 6 and 10 years of age, and death occurs typically during the second or third decade of life. Type A has been reported (van de Kamp et al., 1981) to be the most severe, with earlier onset and rapid progression of symptoms and shorter survival. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type III <br> MPS III includes 4 types, each due to the deficiency of a different enzyme: heparan N-sulfatase (type A); alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (type B; 252920); acetyl CoA:alpha-glucosaminide acetyltransferase (type C; 252930); and N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfatase (type D; 252940). <br>

Multiple types have been described (Mok et al., 2003). <br>
253000=><br> Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease characterized by intracellular accumulation of keratan sulfate and chondroitin-6-sulfate. Key clinical features include short stature, skeletal dysplasia, dental anomalies, and corneal clouding. Intelligence is normal and there is no direct central nervous system involvement, although the skeletal changes may result in neurologic complications. There is variable severity, but patients with the severe phenotype usually do not survive past the second or third decade of life (Montano et al., 2008). <br> McKusick (1972) noted that between 1929 and 1959, a miscellany of skeletal disorders was included in the Morquio category, including various types of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (see, e.g., 183900) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (see, e.g., 132400). <br> Nelson et al.

Symptoms result from the patient's inability to reutilize biotin, a necessary nutrient. Sweetman (1981) recognized that multiple carboxylase deficiency could be classified into early and late forms. The early form showed higher urinary excretion of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid and 3-hydroxypropionic acid than the late form and was associated with normal plasma biotin concentrations. Sweetman (1981) proposed a defect in holocarboxylase synthetase and intestinal biotin absorption, respectively. <br>

The myoclonus, seizures, and hallucinations gradually worsen and become intractable. This is accompanied by progressive cognitive decline, resulting in dementia. About 10 years after onset, affected individuals are in near-continuous myoclonus with absence seizures, frequent generalized seizures, and profound dementia or a vegetative state.

The most common underlying cause is a defect in oxidative phosphorylation (Dahl, 1998). <br> Leigh syndrome may be a feature of a deficiency of any of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes: complex I deficiency (252010), complex II deficiency (252011), complex III deficiency (124000), complex IV deficiency (cytochrome c oxidase; 220110), or complex V deficiency (604273). <br>

256300=><br> The nephrotic syndrome is characterized clinically by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and edema. Kidney biopsies show nonspecific histologic changes such as minimal change, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and diffuse mesangial proliferation. Approximately 20% of affected individuals have an inherited steroid-resistant form and progress to end-stage renal failure (summary by Fuchshuber et al., 1996). <br> Nephrotic syndrome type 1 (NPHS1) is characterized by prenatal onset of massive proteinuria followed by severe steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome apparent at birth with rapid progression to end-stage renal failure (Kestila et al., 1998). <br> Because of confusion in the literature regarding use of the terms 'nephrotic syndrome' and 'focal segmental glomeruloscerlosis' (see NOMENCLATURE section), these disorders in OMIM are classified as NPHS or FSGS according to how they were first designated in the literature. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Nephrotic Syndrome and Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis <br> Nephrotic syndrome and FSGS are genetically heterogeneous disorders representing a spectrum of hereditary renal diseases. See also NPHS2 (600995), caused by mutation in the podocin gene (604766); NPHS3 (610725), caused by mutation in the PLCE1 gene (608414); and NPHS4 (256370), caused by mutation in the WT1 gene (607102). <br> FSGS1 (603278) is caused by mutation in the ACTN4 gene (604638) and FSGS2 (603965) by mutation in the TRPC6 gene (603652). FSGS3 (607832) is associated with variation in the CD2AP gene (604241). FSGS4 (612551) has been mapped to chromosome 22q12, and FSGS5 (613237) is caused by mutation in the INF2 gene (610982). <br>

Renal histopathology in NPHS4 due to WT1 mutations most often shows diffuse mesangial sclerosis (DMS), but can also show focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Both of these terms refer to pathologic findings and may be associated with the same clinical phenotype, namely nephrotic syndrome (review by Schumacher et al., 1998). <br> For a general phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of nephrotic syndrome, see NPHS1 (256300). <br>
256450=><br> Familial hyperinsulinism, also referred to as congenital hyperinsulinism, nesidioblastosis, or persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PPHI), is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infancy and is due to defective negative feedback regulation of insulin secretion by low glucose levels. Unless early and aggressive intervention is undertaken, brain damage from recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia may occur (Thornton et al., 1998). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia <br> HHF2 (601820) is caused by mutation in the KCNJ11 gene (600937), encoding the Kir6.2 subunit of the pancreatic beta cell potassium channel, on chromosome 11p15.1 . HHF3 (602485) is caused by mutation in the glucokinase gene (GCK; 138079) on chromosome 7p15-p13, HHF4 (609975) is caused by mutation in the HADH gene (601609) on chromosome 4q22-q26, HHF5 (609968) is caused by mutation in the insulin receptor gene (INSR; 147670) on chromosome 19p13.2, HHF6 (606762) is caused by mutation in the GLUD1 gene (138130) on chromosome 10q23.3, HHF7 (610021) is caused by mutation in the SLC16A1 (600682) on chromosome 1p13.2-p12, and there is evidence of further genetic heterogeneity of HHF. <br>

256540=><br> Galactosialidosis is a lysosomal storage disease associated with a combined deficiency of beta-galactosidase (611458) and neuraminidase (608272), secondary to a defect in protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA). All patients have clinical manifestations typical of a lysosomal disorder, such as coarse facies, cherry red spots, vertebral changes, foam cells in the bone marrow, and vacuolated lymphocytes. Three phenotypic subtypes are recognized. The early infantile form is associated with fetal hydrops, edema, ascites, visceromegaly, skeletal dysplasia, and early death. The late infantile type is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, growth retardation, cardiac involvement, and rare occurrence of neurologic signs. The juvenile/adult form is characterized by myoclonus, ataxia, angiokeratoma, mental retardation, neurologic deterioration, absence of visceromegaly, and long survival. The majority of reported patients belong to the juvenile/adult group and are mainly of Japanese origin (summary by d'Azzo et al., 2001). <br>
256550=><br> Sialidosis is characterized by the progressive lysosomal storage of sialidated glycopeptides and oligosaccharides caused by a deficiency of the enzyme neuraminidase. Common to the sialidoses is the accumulation and/or excretion of sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid) covalently linked ('bound') to a variety of oligosaccharides and/or glycoproteins. The sialidoses are distinct from the sialurias in which there is storage and excretion of 'free' sialic acid, rather than 'bound' sialic acid; neuraminidase activity in sialuria is normal or elevated. Salla disease (604369) is a form of 'free' sialic acid disease. <br> - Classification <br> Lowden and O'Brien (1979) provided a logical nosology of neuraminidase deficiency into sialidosis type I and type II. Type I is the milder form, also known as the 'normosomatic' type or the cherry red spot-myoclonus syndrome. Sialidosis type II is the more severe form with an earlier onset, and is also known as the 'dysmorphic' type. Type II has been subdivided into juvenile and infantile forms. Other terms for sialidosis type II are mucolipidosis I and lipomucopolysaccharidosis. <br>
256600=><br> Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation 2A is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease characterized by onset in the first 2 years of life; it is also referred to as infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD).

256700=><br> Neuroblastoma is the most common childhood cancer diagnosed before the age of 1 year, and accounts for 10 to 15% of all cancer deaths in children. Some patients inherit a genetic predisposition to neuroblastoma due to germline mutations, whereas others develop sporadic disease that may result from either germline or somatic mutations. Neuroblastoma tumors are derived from embryonic cells that form the primitive neural crest and give rise to the adrenal medulla and the sympathetic nervous system (Roberts et al., 1998; Eng, 2008). Histopathologically, neuroblastoma can range in type from the most aggressive form, neuroblastoma, composed entirely of immature neural precursor cells, to ganglioneuroma, composed entirely of mature neural tissue. The most important prognostic factor for patients with neuroblastoma is the extent of the tumor at the time of diagnosis (Roberts et al., 1998). <br> Neuroblastoma can also be part of cancer-prone syndromes, such as paragangliomas (see, e.g., PGL4; 115310). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Susceptibility to Neuroblastoma <br> Susceptibility to neuroblastoma is genetically heterogeneous and is conferred by mutation in the PHOX2B gene (603851) on chromosome 4p12 (NBLST2; 613013) and by mutation in the ALK gene (105590) on chromosome 2p23 (NBLST3; 613014). <br> Loci implicated in the development of neuroblastoma include 6p (NBLST4; 613015), 2q35 (NBLST5; 613016), and 1q21 (NBLST6; 613017). <br>

256730=><br> The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL; CLN) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the intracellular accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigment storage material in different patterns ultrastructurally. The lipopigment pattern seen most often in CLN1 is referred to as granular osmiophilic deposits (GROD). The patterns most often observed in CLN2 and CLN3 are 'curvilinear' and 'fingerprint' profiles, respectively. CLN4, CLN5, CLN6, CLN7, and CLN8 show mixed combinations of granular, curvilinear, fingerprint, and rectilinear profiles. The clinical course includes progressive dementia, seizures, and progressive visual failure (Mole et al., 2005). <br> Zeman and Dyken (1969) referred to these conditions as the 'neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses.' Goebel (1995) provided a comprehensive review of the NCLs, and noted that they are possibly the most common group of neurodegenerative diseases in children. <br> Mole et al.

257200=><br> Niemann-Pick disease types A and B are caused by an inherited deficiency of acid sphingomyelinase activity. The clinical phenotype ranges from a severe infantile form with neurologic degeneration resulting in death usually by 3 years of age (type A) to a later-onset nonneurologic form (type B) that is compatible with survival into adulthood. Since intermediate cases also have been reported, the disease is best regarded a single entity with a clinical spectrum (summary by Schuchman, 2007). <br> Knudson and Kaplan (1962) suggested that 3 types of the disorder can be distinguished: infantile cerebral, juvenile cerebral, and noncerebral. Later, 5 forms of Niemann-Pick disease were distinguished. Four were delineated by Crocker (1961): the classical infantile form (type A), the visceral form (type B), the subacute or juvenile form (type C; 257220), and the Nova Scotian variant (type D; see 257220). The fifth, the adult form (type E; see 607616), was described by Terry et al. (1954) and Lynn and Terry (1964). Schneider et al. (1978) used the designation type F (see 607616) for a form characterized in 2 patients by a thermolabile enzyme. Most patients fall into Crocker's group A, with death before age 3 years. <br> Schuchman (2007) provided a detailed review of Niemann-Pick disease type A, including clinical management. <br>
257220=><br> Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is an autosomal recessive lipid storage disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration. Approximately 95% of cases are caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene, referred to as type C1; 5% are caused by mutations in the NPC2 gene (601015), referred to as type C2 (607625). The clinical manifestations of types C1 and C2 are similar because the respective genes are both involved in egress of lipids, particularly cholesterol, from late endosomes or lysosomes (Vance, 2006). <br> Historically, Crocker (1961) delineated 4 types of Niemann-Pick disease: the classic infantile form (type A; 257200), the visceral form (type B; 607616), the subacute or juvenile form (type C), and the Nova Scotian variant (type D). Types C1 and D are indistinguishable except for the occurrence of type D in patients of Nova Scotian Acadian ancestry. Since then, types E and F have also been described (see 607616), and phenotypic variation within each group has also been described. <br>

257300=><br> Mosaic variegated aneuploidy is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by mosaic aneuploidies, predominantly trisomies and monosomies, involving multiple different chromosomes and tissues (Hanks et al., 2004). The proportion of aneuploid cells varies but is usually more than 25% and is substantially greater than in normal individuals. Affected individuals typically present with severe intrauterine growth retardation and microcephaly. Eye anomalies, mild dysmorphism, variable developmental delay, and a broad spectrum of additional congenital abnormalities and medical conditions may also occur. The risk of malignancy is high, with rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms tumor, and leukemia reported in several cases. <br>

257350=><br> Fetal cystic hygromas are congenital malformations of the lymphatic system appearing as single or multiloculated fluid-filled cavities, most often in the neck. They are thought to arise from failure of the lymphatic system to communicate with the venous system in the neck. They often progress to hydrops and cause fetal death (Chervenak et al., 1983). <br> CLINIAL FEATURES {1:Bieber et al. (1979)} reported a sibship in <br> which the first and third pregnancies ended in stillborn female infants with a 'bag of water' at the nape of the neck. The mother sought genetic counseling in relation to the fourth pregnancy. Ultrasonography suggested occipital encephalocele, and alpha-1-fetoprotein (AFP; 104150) was greatly elevated. Elective abortion was performed at 21 weeks of gestation. The fetus had a normal 46,XX karyotype and a large nuchal bleb with no evidence of encephalocele. Nuchal bleb in the XO Turner syndrome is also accompanied by elevation of AFP in the amniotic fluid. <br> Chervenak et al. (1983) studied 15 consecutive cases of nuchal hygroma detected prenatally. None survived. In 11, the karyotype was consistent with the Turner syndrome and another probably had XY gonadal dysgenesis. Three had a 46,XX karyotype and 2 of these had multiple malformations. <br> Watson et al. (1990) reported a 29-year-old white female who had consecutive pregnancies in which the fetus was found to have cystic hygroma with hydrops. In 2 of the fetuses, a normal karyotype was documented. Dallapiccola et al. (1984) described a similar patient who had 2 consecutive fetuses with cystic hygroma, both with a normal karyotype. <br> Williams and Josephson (1997) described an Amish family in which 2 brothers had isolated cystic hygroma. A second Amish family had 2 children, a boy and a girl, with congenital chylothorax; both died as a consequence of this condition, one prenatally and one neonatally. The authors stated that familial cystic hygroma not associated with hydrops fetalis and neonatal death had not previously been reported. <br> By ultrasound examinations, Bruni et al. (1999) detected nuchal cystic hygroma and nonimmune hydrops fetalis (236750) in 2 male sibs. Fetal and parental karyotypes were normal. The parents were consanguineous. The parents elected to terminate the 2 pregnancies. Postmortem examination showed no anomalies other than those detected by ultrasound. Autosomal recessive inheritance of this combination of abnormalities was suggested by the observations. <br>

258150=><br> The histologic picture of meiotic arrest is rather constant. Meiotic arrest is characterized by germ cells that enter meiosis and undergo the first chromosomal reduction from 4n to 2n but are then unable to proceed further. This results in tubules containing spermatocytes as the latest developmental stage of germ cells. Meiotically arrested spermatocytes accumulate in the tubules, degenerate, and are easily distinguishable from normal spermatocytes by their partially condensed chromosomes. Although the cause of infertility in patients with meiotic arrest often remains unidentified, this histologic picture can be observed in patients with nonidiopathic infertility as well, such as in the case of microdeletions of the Y-chromosome, chromosomal abnormalities, and cryptorchidism, suggesting that different causal factors can result in the same effect (summary by Luetjens et al., 2004). <br> - Phenotypic and Genetic Heterogeneity of Spermatogenic Failure <br> SPGF1 represents an autosomal recessive form of spermatogenic failure associated with defects in meiosis. SPGF2 (108420) represents a form of spermatogenic failure associated with rearrangements on chromosome 1. Another form of nonobstructive azoospermia (SPGF3; 606766) maps to the HLA class II region on chromosome 6p21.3. A form of azoospermia due to perturbations of meiosis (SPGF4; 270960) is caused by mutation in the SYCP3 gene (604759) on chromosome 12q23. Male infertility due to large-headed, multiflagellar, polyploid sperm (SPGF5; 243060) is caused by mutation in the AURKC gene (603495) on chromosome 19q13.43. Acrosome malformation resulting in globozoospermia (SPGF6; 102530) can be caused by mutation in the SPATA16 gene (609856) on chromosome 3q26.3. Spermatogenic failure-7 (SPGF7; 612997) is caused by mutation in the CATSPER gene (606389) on chromosome 11q13.1. Spermatogenic failure-8 (SPGF8; 613957) is caused by mutation in the NR5A1 gene (184757) on chromosome 9q33. Another form of globozoospermia (SPGF9; 613958) is caused by mutation in the DPY19L2 gene (613893) on chromosome 12q14.2. <br> For a discussion of X chromosome-linked spermatogenic failure, see 305700. For a discussion of Y chromosome-linked spermatogenic failure, see 400042. <br> Spermatogenic failure can also result from underlying endocrinologic disorders (see, e.g., hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, 146110) or ciliary dyskinesias (see, e.g., CILD1, 244400). <br>

Less common features include mitral valve prolapse, cardiomyopathy, and gastrointestinal dysmotility. Both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance can occur; autosomal recessive inheritance is usually more severe (Filosto et al., 2003; Luoma et al., 2004). <br> Drachman (1975) gave a classification of disorders associated with progressive external ophthalmoplegia, which he termed 'ophthalmoplegia plus' (Drachman, 1968). <br>

The disorder was originally defined as 3 separate entities: Torg syndrome, Winchester syndrome, and NAO syndrome. The 2006 revision of the Nosology of Constitutional Disorders of Bone classified Torg and Winchester syndromes as a single entity with NAO syndrome as a variant (Superti-Furga and Unger, 2007). <br> Zankl et al. (2007) defined the continuous clinical spectrum of Torg-Winchester syndrome based on its earlier designations. Torg syndrome is characterized by the presence of multiple, painless, subcutaneous nodules and mild to moderate osteoporosis and osteolysis that is usually limited to the hands and feet. Radiographically, the osteolysis is accompanied by a characteristic widening of the metacarpal and metatarsal bones. Winchester syndrome presents with severe osteolysis in the hands and feet and generalized osteoporosis and bone thinning, similar to NAO, but subcutaneous nodules are characteristically absent. Various additional features including coarse face, corneal opacities, gum hypertrophy, and EKG changes have been reported. NAO syndrome, which has only been described in patients from Saudi Arabia, is generally more severe, with multiple prominent and painful subcutaneous nodules, massive osteolysis in the hands and feet, and generalized osteoporosis. Coarse face and body hirsutism are additional features. <br>

If undiagnosed and untreated, phenylketonuria can result in impaired postnatal cognitive development resulting from a neurotoxic effect of hyperphenylalaninemia (Zurfluh et al., 2008). <br> See Scriver (2007) and Blau et al.

261640=><br> Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)-deficient hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) comprises a genetically heterogeneous group of progressive neurologic disorders caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the genes encoding enzymes involved in the synthesis or regeneration of BH4. BH4 is a cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH; 612349), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; 191290) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH1; 191060), the latter 2 of which are involved in neurotransmitter synthesis. The BH4-deficient HPAs are characterized phenotypically by hyperphenylalaninemia, depletion of the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin, and progressive cognitive and motor deficits (Dudesek et al., 2001). <br> HPABH4A, caused by mutations in the PTS gene, represents the most common cause of BH4-deficient hyperphenylalaninemia (Dudesek et al., 2001). Other forms of BH4-deficient HPA include HPABH4B (233910), caused by mutation in the GCH1 gene (600225), HPABH4C (261630), caused by mutation in the QDPR gene (612676), and HPABH4D (264070), caused by mutation in the PCBD1 gene (126090). Niederwieser et al. (1982) noted that about 1 to 3% of patients with hyperphenylalaninemia have one of these BH4-deficient forms. These disorders are clinically and genetically distinct from classic phenylketonuria (PKU; 261600), caused by mutation in the PAH gene. <br> Two additional disorders associated with BH4 deficiency and neurologic symptoms do not have overt hyperphenylalaninemia as a feature: dopa-responsive dystonia (612716), caused by mutation in the SPR gene (182125), and autosomal dominant dopa-responsive dystonia (DYT5; 128230), caused by mutation in the GCH1 gene.

263000=><br> Interstitial lung disease (ILD), or pneumonitis, is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized pathologically by expansion of the interstitial compartment of the lung by inflammatory cells. Fibrosis occurs in many cases (Visscher and Myers, 2006). <br> Desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP) was originally described as a pathologic entity by Liebow et al. (1965). Lung biopsy shows diffuse and uniform filling of alveoli by clusters of cells which Liebow et al. (1965) speculated to be 'desquamated pneumocytes.' Since then, these cells have been shown primarily to be pigmented alveolar macrophages. Other features include thickened alveolar septa with an infiltrate of inflammatory cells and plump, cuboidal type II pneumocytes. Mild collagen deposition without architectural distortion or honeycombing may be present. Different forms of ILD represent pathologic classifications based on histologic patterns rather than clinical diagnoses and may occur in a variety of clinical contexts (Visscher and Myers, 2006). See also usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP; see 178500), which is associated with pulmonary fibrosis. <br> Although DIP occurs most often as a sporadic disorder in adults during the third to fifth decade of life and is highly associated with smoking (Carrington et al., 1978), reports of a familial form with onset in infancy and early death suggest a genetic basis (Sharief et al., 1994). Cases of DIP reported in infants are often more severe and refractory to treatment than those reported in adults (Nogee et al., 2001). <br> With the advent of molecular genetic analysis, some cases of familial early-onset respiratory insufficiency associated with a pathologic diagnosis of DIP have been shown to result from congenital dysfunction of surfactant metabolism (see, e.g., SMDP1, 265120) due to mutations in genes involved in surfactant metabolism (Nogee et al., 2001; Whitsett and Weaver, 2002). <br>

PV is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized predominantly by erythroid hyperplasia, but also by myeloid leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and splenomegaly. Familial cases of PV are very rare and usually manifest in elderly patients (Cario, 2005). PV is distinct from the familial erythrocytoses (see, e.g., ECYT1, 133100), which are caused by inherited mutations resulting in hypersensitivity of erythroid progenitors to hormonal influences or increased levels of circulating hormones, namely erythropoietin (EPO; 133170) (Prchal, 2005). <br>

The major sources of progesterone are the corpus luteum during the second half of the menstrual cycle and at the beginning of pregnancy, and the placenta. The main hormones responsible for stimulation of progesterone secretion are luteinizing hormone (LH) for the corpus luteum of the menstrual cycle and chorionic gonadotropin for the corpus luteum of pregnancy. Complete end-organ resistance to progesterone would be incompatible with reproductive competence in females. Males would not be expected to be affected since progesterone has no known function in men. Failure of the uterus to respond to progesterone would lead to the development of a 'constantly proliferative' endometrium incompatible with blastocyst implantation. Partial resistance to progesterone, on the other hand, would be expected to be associated with various degrees of incomplete maturation of the endometrium, perhaps expressed clinically as infertility or early abortions. The syndrome would present with the clinical and histologic picture of a luteal phase defect in which the life span of the corpus luteum and the plasma progesterone concentrations would be normal or elevated. <br>

264700=><br> Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), synthesized in the epidermis in response to UV radiation, and dietary vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol, synthesized in plants) are devoid of any biologic activity. Vitamin D hormonal activity is due primarily to the hydroxylated metabolite of vitamin D3, 1-alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol), the actions of which are mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR; 601769) (Koren, 2006; Liberman and Marx, 2001). <br> In the liver, vitamin D 25-hydroxylase (CYP2R1; 608713) catalyzes the initial hydroxylation of vitamin D at carbon 25; in the kidney, 1-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP27B1; 609506) catalyzes the hydroxylation and metabolic activation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 into 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. The active metabolite 1,25(OH)2D3 binds and activates the nuclear vitamin D receptor, with subsequent regulation of physiologic events such as calcium homeostasis and cellular differentiation and proliferation (Takeyama et al., 1997). <br> Disorders of vitamin D metabolism or action lead to defective bone mineralization and clinical features including intestinal malabsorption of calcium, hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, increased renal clearance of phosphorus, and hypophosphatemia. The combination of hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia causes impaired mineralization of bone that results in rickets and osteomalacia (Liberman and Marx, 2001). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Vitamin D-Dependent Rickets <br> Vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1A (VDDR1A) is due to an enzymatic defect in synthesis of the active form of vitamin D caused by mutation in the CYP27B1 gene. VDDR1B (600081) is a form of rickets due to mutation in the gene encoding a vitamin D 25-hydroxylase (CYP2R1; 608713), another enzyme necessary for the synthesis of active vitamin D. Vitamin D-dependent rickets type 2A (VDDR2A; 277440) is caused by end-organ unresponsiveness of active vitamin D due to mutation in the gene encoding the vitamin D receptor (VDR; 601769). VDDR2B 600785 is an unusual form of end-organ unresponsiveness to active vitamin D due to an abnormal protein (see HNRNPC, 164020) that interferes with the function of the VDR. <br> - Other Forms of Hypophosphatemic Rickets <br> For a discussion of other forms of hypophosphatemic rickets, see ADHR (193100). <br>

265050=><br> The term '3MC syndrome' encompasses 4 rare autosomal recessive disorders that were previously designated the Carnevale, Mingarelli, Malpuech, and Michels syndromes, respectively. The main features of these syndromes are facial dysmorphism that includes hypertelorism, blepharophimosis, blepharoptosis, and highly arched eyebrows, which are present in 70% to 95% of cases. Cleft lip and palate, postnatal growth deficiency, cognitive impairment, and hearing loss are also consistent findings, occurring in 40% to 68% of cases. Craniosynostosis, radioulnar synostosis, and genital and vesicorenal anomalies occur in 20% to 30% of cases. Rare features include anterior chamber defects, cardiac anomalies, caudal appendage, umbilical hernia (omphalocele), and diastasis recti (summary by Rooryck et al., 2011). <br> For a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of 3MC syndrome, see 3MC1 (257920). <br>
265100=><br> Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is a rare disease characterized by the deposition of calcium phosphate microliths throughout the lungs (Corut et al., 2006). Most patients are asymptomatic for several years or even for decades, and, generally, the diagnosis is incidental to clinical investigations unrelated to the specific disorder. Cases with early onset or rapid progression are rare. A 'sandstorm-appearing' chest roentgenogram is a typical diagnostic finding. The onset of this potentially lethal disease varies from the neonatal period to old age, and the disease follows a long-term progressive course, resulting in a slow deterioration of lung functions. About one-third of the reported cases are said to be familial. <br>
265120=><br> Inborn errors of pulmonary surfactant metabolism are genetically heterogeneous disorders resulting in severe respiratory insufficiency or failure in full-term neonates or infants. These disorders are associated with various pathologic entities, including pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP), or cellular nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP) (Clark and Clark, 2005). The congenital pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction disorders are distinct from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS; 267450), which affects preterm infants and is associated with the pathologic finding of hyaline membrane disease. Acquired PAP (610910) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of autoantobodies to CSF2 (138960). <br>

265380=><br> Congenital alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACDMPV) is characterized histologically by failure of formation and ingrowth of alveolar capillaries that then do not make contact with alveolar epithelium, medial muscular thickening of small pulmonary arterioles with muscularization of the intraacinar arterioles, thickened alveolar walls, and anomalously situated pulmonary veins running alongside pulmonary arterioles and sharing the same adventitial sheath. Less common features include a reduced number of alveoli and a patchy distribution of the histopathologic changes. The disorder is associated with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate and shows varying degrees of lability and severity (Boggs et al., 1994). Affected infants present with respiratory distress resulting from pulmonary hypertension in the early postnatal period, and the disease is uniformly fatal within the newborn period (Vassal et al., 1998). Additional features of ACDMPV include multiple congenital anomalies affecting the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and musculoskeletal systems, as well as disruption of the normal right-left asymmetry of intrathoracic or intraabdominal organs (Sen et al., 2004). <br>

It is a member of a group of disorders with a defect in the processing of protein-bound glycans. For a general overview of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), see CDG1A (212065) and CDG2A (212066). <br> The neutrophil defect in CDG2C has been referred to as 'leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II' (LAD2), which is a manifestation of the disorder; there are no cases of 'primary' LAD II (Frydman, 1996). <br> Etzioni and Harlan (1999) provided a comprehensive review of both LAD1 (116920) and LAD2. While the functional neutrophil studies are similar in the 2 LADs, the clinical course is milder in LAD2. Furthermore, patients with LAD2 present other abnormal features, such as growth and mental retardation, which are related to the primary defect in fucose metabolism. Delayed separation of the umbilical cord occurs in LAD1. <br>

266300=><br> Two types of melanin, the red pheomelanin and the black eumelanin, are present in human skin. Valverde et al. (1995) noted that eumelanin is photoprotective, whereas pheomelanin may contribute to UV-induced skin damage because of its potential to generate free radicals in response to ultraviolet radiation. Individuals with red hair have a predominance of pheomelanin in hair and skin and/or a reduced ability to produce eumelanin, which may explain why they fail to tan and are at risk from ultraviolet radiation. In mammals, the relative proportions of pheomelanin and eumelanin are regulated by melanocyte-stimulating hormone (see 176830), which acts via its receptor (MC1R) on melanocytes to increase the synthesis of eumelanin, and also via the product of the agouti locus (AGTI; 600201), which antagonizes this action. <br>

However, not all patients show all these features. All patients have accumulation of an unusual branched-chain fatty acid, phytanic acid, in blood and tissues. Other variable features include cardiac dysfunction, nerve deafness, ichthyosis, and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (reviewed by Skjeldal et al., 1987). <br> Increased levels of phytanic acid can also be found in peroxisomal disorders, including Zellweger syndrome (214100), infantile Refsum syndrome (266510), and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP1; 215100), the latter of which is also caused by mutation in the PEX7 gene (601757) (Skjeldal et al., 1987). <br>

267700=><br> Zur Stadt et al. (2005) summarized the clinical features of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by massive infiltration of several organs by activated lymphocytes and macrophages. The clinical features of the disease include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia, and less frequently central nervous system involvement. In FHL, the familial form of the disease, first episodes occur mostly during infancy, with a rapidly fatal outcome if untreated. Diagnostic criteria also include low fibrinogen and high triglyceride and ferritin levels. Chemoimmunotherapy based on corticosteroids, epipodophyllotoxins, and cyclosporin succeeds in controlling the disease in the majority of patients, although remission is rarely obtained (Henter et al., 2002). Most patients suffer an early death unless they are treated by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Durken et al., 1999). <br> Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis exhibits genetic heterogeneity. In some families, familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis has been found to be linked to chromosome 9q (HPLH1, FHL1). FHL2 (603553) is caused by mutation in the PRF1 gene (170280), which maps to 10q22, and FHL3 (608898) is caused by mutation in the UNC13D gene (608897), which maps to 17q25.1. FHL4 (603552) is caused by mutation in the syntaxin-11 gene (STX11; 605014), and FHL5 (613101) is caused by mutation in the syntaxin-binding protein-2 (STXBP2; 601717), which is an interaction partner of STX11. <br> Furthermore, before the definition of mutations in the RAG1 (179615) and RAG2 (179616) genes, both of which map to 11p, Omenn syndrome (familial reticuloendotheliosis with eosinophilia; 603554) was not thought to be clearly distinct from other reported cases of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. A form of histiocytosis associated with sensorineural deafness and joint contractures, referred to as Faisalabad histiocytosis (602782), has been mapped to 11q25. Further genetic heterogeneity in familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis was suggested by a study in which FHL in 2 unrelated Canadian families with affected first cousins was not linked to 9q21.3-q22 or 10q21-q22 (Graham et al., 2000). <br>

Symptoms include night blindness, the development of tunnel vision, and slowly progressive decreased central vision starting at approximately 20 years of age. Upon examination, patients have decreased visual acuity, constricted visual fields, dyschromatopsia (tritanopic; see 190900), and the classic fundus appearance with dark pigmentary clumps in the midperiphery and perivenous areas ('bone spicules'), attenuated retinal vessels, cystoid macular edema, fine pigmented vitreous cells, and waxy optic disc pallor. RP is associated with posterior subcapsular cataracts in 39 to 72% of patients, high myopia, astigmatism, keratoconus, and mild hearing loss in 30% of patients (excluding patients with Usher syndrome; see 276900).

The clefts are lined with gray matter and most commonly involve the parasylvian regions (Wolpert and Barnes, 1992). Large portions of the cerebral hemispheres may be absent and replaced by cerebrospinal fluid. Two types of schizencephaly have been described, depending on the size of the area involved and the separation of the cleft lips (Wolpert and Barnes, 1992). Type I schizencephaly consists of a fused cleft. This fused pial-ependymal seam forms a furrow in the developing brain, and is lined by polymicrogyric gray matter. In type II schizencephaly, there is a large defect, a holohemispheric cleft in the cerebral cortex filled with fluid and lined by polymicrogyric gray matter. The clinical manifestations depend on the severity of the lesion. Patients with type I are often almost normal; they may have seizures and spasticity. In type II abnormalities, there is usually mental retardation, seizures, hypotonia, spasticity, inability to walk or speak, and blindness. <br> Schizencephaly may be part of the larger phenotypic spectrum of holoprosencephaly (HPE; see 236100). <br>

270400=><br> Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is an autosomal recessive multiple congenital malformation and mental retardation syndrome. Although historically a clinical distinction was often made between a classic 'type I' disorder and a more severe 'type II' disorder, in reality the syndrome constitutes a clinical and biochemical continuum from mild to severe (Opitz et al., 1987; Cunniff et al., 1997; Kelley, 1998). <br> The discovery of the deficiency of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase as a causative factor of the SLO syndrome (Tint et al., 1994) made this syndrome the first true metabolic syndrome of multiple congenital malformations. A multidisciplinary National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) conference of the SLO syndrome reviewed different implications of this discovery and proposed further studies in this field. A detailed report on this conference and abstracts of presentations were provided by Opitz and de la Cruz (1994). Observations presented at an NICHD RSH/SLOS conference in September 1995 were reviewed by Kelley (1997). Kelley (1998) referred to SLOS as a metabolic malformation syndrome, but suggested that this may be an exception. Most mutations that had been related to multiple congenital malformation syndromes, i.e., disturbances of the body plan, have not been disorders of intermediary metabolism but, instead, mutations of homeobox genes and other transcriptional regulators and signaling systems. <br> Opitz et al. (1987) gave a presumedly complete bibliography of the SLO syndrome, which was updated by Opitz et al. (1994) and included almost 200 references.

Inheritance is most often autosomal dominant (see 182600), but X-linked (see 303350) and autosomal recessive forms also occur. <br> Autosomal recessive forms of SPG include SPG7 (607259), caused by mutation in the paraplegin gene (602783) on chromosome 16q24; SPG20 (275900), caused by mutation in the spartin gene (607111) on 13q12; SPG21 (248900), caused by mutation in the maspardin gene (608181) on 15q21; SPG39 (612020), caused by mutation in the PNPLA6 gene (603197) on 19p13.3; SPG44 (613206), caused by mutation in the GJC2 gene (608803) on 1q41-q42; SPG48 (613647), caused by mutation in the KIAA0415 gene (613653) on chromosome 7p22.1. <br> Additional autosomal recessive forms of SPG have been mapped to chromosomes 15q (SPG11; 604360), 3q (SPG14; 605229), 14q (SPG15; 270700), 8p12-p11 (SPG18; 611225), 13q14 (SPG24; 607584), 6q (SPG25; 608220), 12 (SPG26; 609195), 10q22 (SPG27; 609041), 14q21-q22 (SPG28; 609340), 2q37.3 (SPG30; 610357), 16q21-q23 (SPG35; 612319), and 10q24.3-q25.1 (SPG45; 613162). <br>

Type 1 brachyolmia includes the Hobaek and Toledo (271630) forms and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Both forms of type 1 are characterized by scoliosis, platyspondyly with rectangular and elongated vertebral bodies, overfaced pedicles, and irregular, narrow intervertebral spaces. The Toledo form is distinguished by the presence of corneal opacities and precocious calcification of the costal cartilage. Type 2 brachyolmia (613678), sometimes referred to as the Maroteaux type, is also an autosomal recessive disorder, primarily distinguished from type 1 by rounded vertebral bodies and less overfaced pedicles. Some cases are associated with precocious calcification of the falx cerebri. Type 3 brachyolmia (113500) is an autosomal dominant form, caused by mutation in the TRPV4 gene (605427), with severe kyphoscoliosis and flattened, irregular cervical vertebrae. Paradoxically, although the limbs are mildly shortened in all types of brachyolmia, they show minimal epiphyseal and metaphyseal abnormalities on radiographs. <br>

The range of virilizing effects due to early testicular tissue extends from none in phenotypic females with only slightly hypoplastic normal external genitalia, well-formed but hypoplastic uterus, and well-formed tubes (De Marchi et al., 1981) to the anorchic phenotypic male (Edman et al., 1977). Most affected individuals lack a vagina but a urogenital sinus or pseudovaginal urethral outpouching is found.

Dyshormonogenesis can be caused by recessive defects at any of the steps required for normal thyroid hormone synthesis. In untreated patients thyroid dyshormonogenesis is typically associated with goitrous enlargement of the thyroid secondary to long-term thyrotropin (TSH; see 188540) stimulation. <br> Park and Chatterjee (2005) reviewed the genetics of primary congenital hypothyroidism, summarizing the different phenotypes associated with known genetic defects and proposing an algorithm for investigating the genetic basis of the disorder. <br>
274500=><br> Approximately 10% of patients with congenital hypothyroidism harbor inborn errors of metabolism in one of the steps for thyroid hormone synthesis in thyrocytes (Vono-Toniolo et al., 2005). The most prevalent cause of thyroid dyshormonogenesis is TPO deficiency (Park and Chatterjee, 2005). Defects in TPO cause a severe form of congenital hypothyroidism characterized by a complete and immediate release of accumulated radioiodide from the thyroid after sodium perchlorate administration (Bakker et al., 2000). This release of radioiodide represents total iodine organification defect (TIOD), a disruption of the process by which iodide present in the thyroid is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide and bound to tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin (TG; 188450) to form iodotyrosine. <br>
274600=><br> Pendred syndrome, the most common syndromal form of deafness, is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with developmental abnormalities of the cochlea, sensorineural hearing loss, and diffuse thyroid enlargement (goiter) (Everett et al., 1997). <br>

Inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, the disorder in the majority of patients causes large goiters of elastic and soft consistency. Although the degree of thyroid dysfunction varies considerably among patients with defective TG synthesis, patients usually have a relatively high serum free T3 concentration with disproportionately low free T4 level. The maintenance of relatively high FT3 levels prevents profound tissue hypothyroidism except in brain and pituitary, which are dependent on T4 supply, resulting in neurologic and intellectual defects in some cases. <br>

(2005) noted that the original definition of Turcot syndrome may be too restrictive, and suggested that the full manifestation of biallelic mutations in MMR genes includes the additional findings of early-onset hematologic malignancies and cafe-au-lait spots suggestive of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1; 162200). <br> Several authors have observed 2 main groups of so-called 'Turcot syndrome.' Itoh and Ohsato (1985) noted that the colonic lesions seen in Turcot's original cases were characterized by autosomal recessive inheritance and multiple colonic polyps (up to 100), some of which exceeded 3 cm in diameter; the polyps frequently showed malignant transformation in the second and third decades of life. A distinct group of patients showed autosomal dominant inheritance of multiple small colonic polyps similar to classic FAP; the CNS tumor in these patients appeared to be an additional chance occurrence. Due to the similar phenotypes, FAP patients with brain tumors have sometimes been referred to in the past as having 'Turcot syndrome' (see, e.g., Lewis et al., 1983 and Lasser et al., 1994). <br> Mastronardi et al. (1991) and Dupuis and Verellen-Dumoulin (1995) also identified 2 distinct syndromes comprising polyposis and CNS tumors. One shows autosomal recessive inheritance of polyps and gliomas, with CNS tumors as a primary feature; this group includes the original kindred of Turcot et al. (1959). The other group shows autosomal dominant FAP with CNS tumors, usually medulloblastomas, as an extracolonic manifestation. The colonic polyps in Turcot syndrome occur earlier, are less numerous and larger, and undergo malignant transformation earlier compared to those in FAP. <br> Paraf et al. (1997) also proposed that Turcot syndrome, which they referred to as the 'brain tumor-polyposis (BTP) syndrome,' could be classified into 2 distinct entities. Patients with BTP syndrome type 1 have early onset of malignant gliomas and colorectal adenomas without polyposis; these are non-FAP cases. Neoplasms from these patients show DNA replication errors consistent with mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes. In contrast, BTP syndrome type 2 includes patients in FAP kindreds who develop CNS tumors. These patients have germline APC mutations which predispose to brain tumors. Risk analysis showed an increased incidence of medulloblastoma in FAP patients. By contrast, APC mutations were not found in sporadic glioma or medulloblastoma. <br> Wimmer and Etzler (2008) provided a review of the mismatch cancer repair syndrome and suggested that the prevalence may be underestimated. <br>

Type I is distinguished from type II (276901) on the basis of severity of hearing loss and the extent of vestibular involvement. Type I patients are profoundly deaf, whereas type II patients are 'hard of hearing.' Vestibular function is defective in type I patients, whereas type II patients have normal vestibular function (Moller et al., 1989). Patients with type III (USH3; 276902) have progressive hearing loss. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Usher Syndrome Type I <br> USH type I is genetically heterogeneous. USH1C (276904), the 'Acadian variety,' is caused by mutation in harmonin (605242), on 11p15.1. USH1D (601067) and USH1F (602083) are caused by mutation in the cadherin-23 (CDH23; 605516) and protocadherin-15 (PCDH15; 605514) genes, respectively; both of these genes map to 10q21-q22. USH1G (606943) is caused by mutation in the SANS gene (607696), on 17q24-q25. USH1E (602097) maps to 21q21, and USH1H (612632) maps to 15q22-q23. <br> A form of USH type I in which affected members carried heterozygous mutations in both CDH23 and PCDH15 has been reported (USH1D/F; see 601067), thus supporting a digenic model for some individuals with this phenotype. <br> Gerber et al. (2006) presented evidence that the form of USH1 previously called USH1A, or the 'French variety,' and mapped to chromosome 14 does not in fact exist; mutations in the MYO7A gene were found in most of these families, and in others the phenotype was found to map to other loci. <br> Ahmed et al.

276901=><br> Usher syndrome is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing deficiencies at birth and later development of progressive retinitis pigmentosa (RP). It is the most frequent cause of combined deafness and blindness in adults and affects 3 to 6% of children born with hearing impairment. In brief, patients with Usher syndrome type II have mild hearing impairment with normal vestibular responses. Type II is the most common of the 3 Usher syndromes (Eudy et al., 1998). See 276900 for clinical characterization of Usher syndrome types I, II, and III. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Usher Syndrome Type II <br> Usher syndrome type II is genetically heterogeneous. USH2C (605472) can be caused by mutation in the GPR98 gene (602851) or by biallelic digenic mutation in the GPR98 and PDZD7 (612791) genes. USH2D (611383) is caused by mutation in the WHRN gene (607928). <br> The locus designation USH2B has been withdrawn; see HISTORY. <br>
276902=><br> Usher syndrome type III is characterized by postlingual, progressive hearing loss, variable vestibular dysfunction, and onset of retinitis pigmentosa symptoms, including nyctalopia, constriction of the visual fields, and loss of central visual acuity, usually by the second decade of life (Karjalainen et al., 1985; Pakarinen et al., 1995). <br>
276903=><br> The MYO7A gene encodes a protein classified as an unconventional myosin. Unconventional myosins are motor molecules with structurally conserved heads that move along actin filaments.

277450=><br> Deficiency of all vitamin K-dependent clotting factors leads to a bleeding tendency that is usually reversed by oral administration of vitamin K. Acquired forms of the disorder can be caused by intestinal malabsorption of vitamin K. Familial multiple coagulation factor deficiency is rare. Clinical symptoms of the disease include episodes of intracranial hemorrhage in the first weeks of life, sometimes leading to a fatal outcome. The pathomechanism is based on a reduced hepatic gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues of all vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation factors, as well as the anticoagulant factors protein C (612283) and protein S (176880). Posttranslational gamma-carboxylation of proteins enables the calcium-dependent attachment of the proteins to the phospholipid bilayer of membranes, an essential prerequisite for blood coagulation. Vitamin K1 acts as a cofactor for the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase in liver microsomes, GGCX. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Combined Deficiency of Vitamin K-Dependent Clotting Factors <br> Combined deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors-2 (VKFCD2; 607473) is caused by mutation in the gene encoding vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1; 608547) on chromosome 16p12-q21. <br>

277480=><br> Von Willebrand disease is a bleeding disorder resulting from a defect in platelet aggregation due to defects in the von Willebrand factor protein. Type 3 von Willebrand disease, which is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder, is associated with a severe quantitative defect or virtual absence of VWF in plasma, a prolonged bleeding time, and more severe bleeding tendencies compared to the other types of VWD. Type 3 accounts for about 1% of patients with VWD. Bleeding usually starts in infancy and can include epistaxis, recurrent mucocutaneous bleeding, bleeding after surgery, and hemarthroses. Since VWF also serves as a carrier protein for coagulation factor VIII (F8; 300841), affected individuals also have very low levels of plasma F8, resembling hemophilia A (306700) (summaries by Zhang et al., 1992, 1993; reviews by Sadler et al., 2006 and Lillicrap, 2009). <br> For a general description and a classification of the types of von Willebrand disease, see VWD type 1 (193400). <br>

RSK proteins are directly phosphorylated and activated by MAPK proteins (e.g, ERK1; 601795) in response to growth factors, polypeptide hormones, and neurotransmitters, and then subsequently phosphorylate many substrates. RSKs appear to have important roles in cell cycle progression, differentiation, and cell survival (review by Marques Pereira et al., 2010). <br>

The t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) translocation is closely associated with the development of synovial sarcoma. Through translocations, the SYT gene (600192) on chromosome 18 fuses with a member of the SSX gene family, all located on the X chromosome, resulting in the generation of either an SYT-SSX1 (312820), SYT-SSX2 (300192), or, rarely, an SYT-SSX4 fusion gene. Alteration is detected in more than 90% of cases and frequently occurs as a single abnormality. The resulting SYT-SSX fusion is always retained during tumor progression, while the reciprocal SSX-SYT fusion is frequently eliminated (Panagopoulos et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2002). <br>

The superfamily contains membrane proteins that translocate a wide variety of substrates across extra- and intracellular membranes, including metabolic products, lipids and sterols, and drugs. Overexpression of certain ABC transporters occurs in cancer cell lines and tumors that are multidrug resistant such as ABCB1/MDR1 (171050), ABCC1/MRP1 (158343), and ABCG2 (603756).

300373=><br> Osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis (OSCS) is an X-linked dominant sclerosing bone dysplasia that presents in females with macrocephaly, cleft palate, mild learning disabilities, sclerosis of the long bones and skull, and longitudinal striations visible on radiographs of the long bones, pelvis, and scapulae (Jenkins et al., 2009). In males this entity is usually associated with fetal or neonatal lethality. Occasional surviving males have, in addition to hyperostosis, cardiac, intestinal, and genitourinary malformations. Osteosclerosis in the cranial and facial bones leads to disfigurement and to disability due to pressure on cranial nerves, e.g., deafness. Osteopathia striata is a frequent feature of focal dermal hypoplasia (FDH; 305600). <br> Although early reports of familial cases of this disorder appeared to suggest autosomal dominant inheritance (see, e.g., Horan and Beighton, 1978 and Konig et al., 1996), reappraisal of the literature (Behninger and Rott, 2000; Rott et al., 2003) and the finding of a molecular basis for the disorder by Jenkins et al. (2009) confirms that the inheritance pattern is X-linked dominant. Affected males who survive have a more severe phenotype than affected females, and sporadic male cases may result from somatic mosaicism (Behninger and Rott, 2000). <br>

They create considerable structural diversity among chondroitin sulfates by transferring sulfate with remarkable specificity for the underlying oligosaccharide substrate.

300376=><br> The muscular dystrophy that carries the Becker eponym is similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy in the distribution of muscle wasting and weakness, which is mainly proximal, but the course is more benign, with age of onset around 12 years; some patients have no symptoms until much later in life. Loss of ambulation also varies from adolescence onward, with death usually in the fourth or fifth decade. In some cases, as in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a degree of mental impairment is present (Emery, 2002). <br> As in DMD, about 5 to 10% of female carriers of this X-linked disorder show muscle weakness, and frequently enlarged calves--so-called manifesting heterozygotes. Such weakness is often asymmetric; it can develop in childhood or not become evident until adult life, and can be slowly progressive or remain static. Because weakness is essentially proximal, differentiation from limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is essential for genetic counseling. In both DMD and BMD, female carriers may develop dilated cardiomyopathy in the absence of apparent weakness (Grain et al., 2001). <br>

300383=><br> Properdin (factor P) is a plasma protein that is active in the alternative complement pathway of the innate immune system. It is a positive regulatory factor that binds to many microbial surfaces to stabilize the C3b,Bb convertase. The C3b,Bb convertase then rapidly cleaves more C3 to C3b, which acts either as an opsonin or to reinitiate the pathway in an amplification loop that proceeds on the bacterial cell, but not on the host cell (Janeway et al., 2001). In the alternative pathway, C3 is thus activated through factor B, factor D, and properdin P, under the control of factors I and H (Fearon and Austen, 1980). Deficiency of properdin is associated in particular with a heightened susceptibility to Neisseria species (Janeway et al., 2001). <br>

All but the perisylvian form appear to be rare. Bilateral perisylvian PMG (BPP) often results in a typical clinical syndrome that is manifested by mild mental retardation, epilepsy, and pseudobulbar palsy, which causes difficulties with expressive speech and feeding (Kuzniecky et al., 1993). <br> PMG may be a feature of other conditions as well (see, e.g., 300643). <br>

The biologic effects of arginine vasopressin (AVP; 192340) are mediated by 3 receptor subtypes: the V1A (600821) and V1B (600264) receptors that activate phospholipases via Gq/11, and the V2 receptor that activates adenylyl cyclase by interacting with G(s). In the collecting ducts of the kidney, the AVPR2 receptor is involved in the maintenance of water homeostasis (Birnbaumer, 2000). <br>
300539=><br> The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a common cause of hyponatremia. The syndrome manifests as an inability to excrete a free water load, with inappropriately concentrated urine and resultant hyponatremia, hypoosmolality, and natriuresis. SIADH occurs in a setting of normal blood volume, without evidence of renal disease or deficiency of thyroxine or cortisol. Although usually transient, SIADH may be chronic; it is often associated with drug use or a lesion in the central nervous system or lung. When the cardinal features of SIADH were defined by Bartter and Schwartz (1967), levels of AVP could not be measured. Subsequently, radioimmunoassays revealed that SIADH is usually associated with measurably elevated serum levels of AVP. Nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (NSIAD) is characterized by a clinical picture similar to SIADH, but is associated with undetectable levels of AVP (Feldman et al., 2005). <br>

300746=><br> The F9 gene encodes coagulation factor IX, which circulates as an inactive zymogen until proteolytic release of its activation peptide allows it to assume the conformation of an active serine protease (Davie and Fujikawa, 1975). Its role in the blood coagulation cascade is to activate factor X (F10; 227600) through interactions with calcium, membrane phospholipids, and factor VIII (F8; 300841). Factor IX and factor X both consist of 2 polypeptide chains referred to as the L (light) and H (heavy) chains. The H chain bears a structural resemblance to the polypeptide chain of the pancreatic serine protease trypsin (PRSS1; 276000). The L chain is covalently linked to the H chain by a single disulfide bond (Fujikawa et al., 1974). <br>

The age of clinical onset of the disorder can vary from in utero to the ninth decade. Whereas males are preferentially affected, females may present with clinically severe anemia. More commonly, female carriers of the disease have an increased red blood cell distribution width and sometimes erythrocyte dimorphism (Fleming, 2002). <br>

300755=><br> X-linked agammaglobulinemia is an immunodeficiency characterized by failure to produce mature B lymphocytes and associated with a failure of Ig heavy chain rearrangement. The defect in this disorder resides in BTK, also known as BPK or ATK, a key regulator in B-cell development (Rawlings and Witte, 1994). The X-linked form accounts for approximately 85 to 90% of cases of the disorder. Also see 300310. The remaining 15% of cases constitute a heterogeneous group of autosomal disorders (Lopez Granados et al., 2002; Ferrari et al., 2007).

300770=><br> Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung disorder in which surfactant-derived lipoproteins accumulate excessively within pulmonary alveoli, causing severe respiratory distress. Three forms of PAP have been described: congenital, secondary, and acquired. Congenital PAP is associated with mutations in the CSF2RA gene or in genes encoding surfactant proteins. Secondary PAP develops in conditions in which there are reduced numbers or functional impairment of alveolar macrophages and is associated with inhalation of inorganic dust (silica) or toxic fumes, hematologic malignancies, pharmacologic immunosuppression, infections, and impaired CSF2RB (138960) expression. Acquired PAP (610910), the most common form, usually occurs in adults and is caused by neutralizing autoantibodies to CSF2 (138960) (Martinez-Moczygemba et al., 2008). <br> For a general phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of congenital pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction, see SMDP1 (265120). <br>

Hepatic phosphorylase kinase is a hexadecameric enzyme comprising 4 copies each of 4 unique subunits encoded by 4 different genes: alpha (PHKA2), beta (PHKB, 172490), gamma (PHKG2, (172471)), and delta. The delta subunit can be encoded by 3 different genes (CALM1, 114180; CALM2, 114182; or CALM3, 114183). The PHKA1 (311870) and PHKG1 (172470) genes encode the alpha and gamma subunits, respectively, of muscle phosphorylase kinase; the beta subunit is the same in both isoforms. The gamma subunits contain the active site of the enzyme, whereas the alpha and beta subunits have regulatory functions controlled by phosphorylation. The delta subunit, which encodes calmodulin, mediates the dependence of the enzyme on calcium concentration (Beauchamp et al., 2007). <br>

300818=><br> Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an uncommon acquired hemolytic anemia that often manifests with hemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, smooth muscle dystonias, fatigue, and thrombosis. The disease results from the expansion of hematopoietic stem cells harboring a mutation in the PIGA gene, which encodes a protein required for the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), a lipid moiety that attaches dozens of proteins to the cell surface. Thus, PNH cells are deficient in cell surface GPI-anchored proteins. This deficiency on erythrocytes leads to intravascular hemolysis, since certain GPI-anchored proteins (i.e., CD55 (125240) and CD59 (107271)) normally function as complement regulators. Free hemoglobin released from intravascular hemolysis leads to circulating nitrous oxide depletion and is responsible for many of the clinical manifestations of PNH, including fatigue, erectile dysfunction, esophageal spasm, and thrombosis (review by Brodsky, 2008). <br>

Onset of neurologic symtoms ranges between 25 and 60 years (mean onset 30 to 40 years), and penetrance appears to be high. Additional symptoms include generalized seizures, neuromuscular symptoms leading to weakness and atrophy, and cardiomyopathy mainly manifesting with atrial fibrillation, malignant arrythmias, and dilated cardiomyopathy (summary by Jung et al., 2007). <br> The cooccurrence of McLeod syndrome and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD; 306400) results from a contiguous gene deletion (Francke et al., 1985). <br>

Hall et al. (1982) distinguished at least 3 varieties of X-linked arthrogryposis, which probably are caused by mutation at different loci because the nature of the basic defect seems quite distinctive in each. (1) One family had a severe lethal form with severe contractures, scoliosis, chest deformities, hypotonia, micrognathia, and death from respiratory insufficiency by age 3 months. Apparently progressive loss of anterior horn cells was the cause. (2) Two families had moderately severe AMC associated with ptosis, microphallus, cryptorchidism, inguinal hernias, and normal intelligence. Nonprogressive intrauterine myopathy appeared to be the 'cause'. (3) In 2 families and a sporadic case, the disorder took the form of a resolving AMC, with mild to moderate contractures improving dramatically with time, normal intelligence, and no other anomalies; tight connective tissues on misplaced tendons was postulated. <br>

302800=><br> Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease constitutes a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of hereditary motor and sensory peripheral neuropathies. On the basis of electrophysiologic properties and histopathology, CMT has been divided into primary peripheral demyelinating (type 1) and primary peripheral axonal (type 2) neuropathies. The demyelinating neuropathies classified as CMT type 1, also known as HMSN I, are characterized by severely reduced motor nerve conduction velocities (NCV) (less than 38 m/s) and segmental demyelination and remyelination with onion bulb formations on nerve biopsy (see CMT1B; 118200). The axonal neuropathies classified as CMT type 2, also known as HMSN II, are characterized by normal or mildly reduced NCVs and chronic axonal degeneration and regeneration on nerve biopsy (see CMT2A1; 118210). Distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) (see 158590) is a spinal type of CMT characterized by exclusive motor involvement and sparing of sensory nerves (Pareyson, 1999). There are X-linked, autosomal dominant (see 118200), and autosomal recessive (see 214400) forms of CMT. <br> The form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy that maps to chromosome Xq13 (CMTX1) is X-linked dominant or X-linked intermediate; heterozygous females are more mildly affected than are hemizygous males. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease <br> CMTX5 (311070) is due to mutation in the PRPS1 gene (311850) on chromosome Xq21-q24. Ionasescu et al. (1991) presented data suggesting the existence of 2 separate loci for X-linked recessive disorders mapping to other sites: CMTX2 (302801), which maps to chromosome Xp22.2, and CMTX3 (302802), which maps to chromosome Xq26 (302802). Cowchock syndrome (310490), which maps to chromosome Xq24-q26, may be referred to as CMTX4. <br>

X-linked dominant CDP, also known as Conradi-Hunermann syndrome, is the most well-characterized form. See 118650 for a possible autosomal dominant form of CDP. There are 2 brachytelephalangic forms of CDP: an X-linked recessive form (CDPX1; 302950), caused by mutation in the ARSE gene (300180), and a possible autosomal form (BCDP; 602497).

(1996) and Fink (1997). Some forms of SPG are considered 'uncomplicated,' i.e., progressive spasitity occurs in isolation; others are considered 'complicated,' i.e., progressive spasticity occurs with other neurologic features. X-linked, autosomal dominant (see 182600), and autosomal recessive (see 270800) forms of SPG have been described. <br> Spastic paraplegia-1 is usually called MASA syndrome, the designation originally suggested by Bianchine and Lewis (1974), because the main clinical features are summarized by the acronym MASA (mental retardation, aphasia, shuffling gait, and adducted thumbs). The shuffling gait is probably caused by spasticity of the lower limbs, and all affected males have been reported to have increased reflexes. The adducted thumbs are thought to be caused by hypoplastic or absent extensor pollicis longus or brevis muscles. In affected males, the onset of speech is delayed (Winter et al., 1989). <br> See 314100 for isolated X-linked congenital clasped thumb and 201550 for an autosomal adducted thumbs syndrome. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of X-linked Spastic Paraplegia <br> Other forms of X-linked spastic paraplegia included SPG2 (312920), which is caused by mutation in the myelin proteolipid protein gene (PLP1; 300401); SPG16 (300266), which maps to Xq11.2-q23; and SPG34 (300750), which maps to Xq24-q25. <br>

303631=><br> The COL4A6 gene encodes the collagen type IV alpha-6 isoform, which is a component of the basement membrane. Basement membranes compartmentalize tissues and provide important signals for the differentiation of the cells they support. Type IV collagen, the major component of basement membranes, is a triple-helical molecule composed of 3 alpha chains. The alpha-1 (COL4A1; 120130) and alpha-2 (COL4A2; 120090) chains are ubiquitous, whereas the alpha-3 (COL4A3; 120070), alpha-4 (COL4A4; 120131) and alpha-5 (COL4A5; 303630) chains have restricted tissue distributions. On the basis of sequence similarities, the chains fall into 2 classes: alpha-1, alpha-3, and alpha-5 compose the alpha-1-like class, and alpha-2, alpha-4, and alpha-6 compose the alpha-2-like class. The COL4A1 and COL4A2 genes are located in a head-to-head configuration on chromosome 13 and the COL4A3 and COL4A4 genes are similarly arranged on chromosome 2. Thus, it appears that the type IV collagens evolved by duplication of an ancestral alpha-chain gene, giving rise to a pair of alpha-chain genes with closely apposed 5-prime ends (Oohashi et al., 1994; Zhou et al., 1994). <br>

303700=><br> Blue cone (OPN1SW; 613522) monochromatism is a rare X-linked congenital stationary cone dysfunction syndrome characterized by the absence of functional long wavelength-sensitive and medium wavelength-sensitive cones in the retina. Color discrimination is severely impaired from birth, and vision is derived from the remaining preserved blue (S) cones and rod photoreceptors. BCM typically presents with reduced visual acuity, pendular nystagmus, and photophobia. Patients often have myopia (review by Gardner et al., 2009). There is evidence for progression of disease in some BCM families (Nathans et al., 1989; Ayyagari et al., 2000; Michaelides et al., 2005). <br>
303800=><br> Normal color vision in humans is trichromatic, being based on 3 classes of cone that are maximally sensitive to light at approximately 420 nm (blue cones; 613522), 530 nm (green cones; 300821), and 560 nm (red cones; 300822). Comparison by neural circuits of light absorption by the 3 classes of cone photoreceptors allows perception of red, yellow, green, and blue colors individually or in various combinations. Dichromatic color vision is severely defective color vision based on the use of only 2 types of photoreceptors, blue plus green (protanopia; see 303900) or blue plus red (deuteranopia). Anomalous trichromacy is trichromatic color vision based on a blue, green, and an anomalous red-like photoreceptor (protanomaly), or a blue, red, and an anomalous green-like photoreceptor (deuteranomaly). The color vision defect is generally mild but may in certain cases be severe. Common variation in red-green color vision exists among both normal and color-deficient individuals (review by Deeb, 2005). <br>

At the mild end of the spectrum, males with OPD1 have cleft palate and mild skeletal anomalies with conductive deafness caused by ossicular anomalies. FMD is characterized by a generalized skeletal dysplasia, deafness and urogenital defects. Males with OPD2 have disabling skeletal anomalies in addition to variable malformations in the hindbrain, heart, intestines, and kidneys that frequently lead to perinatal death. The most severe phenotype, MNS, is characterized by a skeletal dysplasia in the heterozygote. Affected males exhibit severe malformations similar to those observed in individuals with OPD2, resulting in prenatal lethality or death in the first few months of life (review by Robertson, 2005).

Patients with mild hemophilia usually bleed excessively only after trauma or surgery, whereas those with severe hemophilia have an annual average of 20 to 30 episodes of spontaneous or excessive bleeding after minor trauma, particularly into joints and muscles.

The classic laboratory findings in hemophilia B include a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and a normal prothrombin time (PT) (Lefkowitz et al., 1993). <br> Early studies made a distinction between cross-reactive-material (CRM)-negative and CRM-positive hemophilia B mutants. This classification referred to detection of the F9 antigen in plasma, even in the presence of decreased F9 activity. Detection of the antigen indicated the presence of a dysfunctional F9 protein. Roberts et al. (1968) found that about 90% of patients with hemophilia B were CRM-negative, whereas about 10% were CRM-positive. However, Bertina and Veltkamp (1978) found that a rather large proportion of the hemophilia B patients could be characterized as hemophilia B CRM+. They identified 14 cases of hemophilia B CRM+ from 11 families among a group of 33 patients. After immunologic and activity comparisons, they found at least 7 different factor IX variants. Bertina and Veltkamp (1978) noted the high heterogeneity within this group. In an editorial on variants of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, Bertina et al. (1979) stated that 9 defective variants of factor II, 5 variants of factor X, and many variants (about 180 pedigrees) of factor IX had been identified.

HPRT1 encodes hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.8), which catalyzes conversion of hypoxanthine to inosine monophosphate and guanine to guanosine monophosphate via transfer of the 5-phosphoribosyl group from 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (Keebaugh et al., 2007). <br>

See, e.g., autosomal dominant ichthyosis vulgaris (146700), which is caused by mutations in the filaggrin gene (FLG; 135940). Ichthyosis can also be observed in multiple sulfatase deficiency (272200) (Shapiro, 1977). <br> X-linked ichthyosis is fundamentally the same disorder as placental steroid sulfatase deficiency, which is often first noted in the pregnant mother of affected males by decreased estrogen or delayed progression of parturition (Alperin and Shapiro, 1997). This is thus an example of affinity ('lumping') of phenotypes thought previously to be separate, the opposite of genetic heterogeneity. <br> Schnyder (1970) gave a useful classification of the inherited ichthyoses. <br> Hernandez-Martin et al. (1999) provided a comprehensive review of X-linked ichthyosis. They pointed out that among all genetic disorders X-linked ichthyosis shows one of the highest ratios of chromosomal deletions; complete deletion has been found in up to 90% of patients. <br>

In affected females it causes highly variable abnormalities of the skin, hair, nails, teeth, eyes, and central nervous system. The prominent skin signs occur in 4 classic cutaneous stages: perinatal inflammatory vesicles, verrucous patches, a distinctive pattern of hyperpigmentation, and dermal scarring. Cells expressing the mutated X chromosome are eliminated selectively around the time of birth, so females with IP exhibit extremely skewed X-inactivation. <br> Familial incontinentia pigmenti is caused by mutations in the NEMO gene and is here referred to as IP2, or 'classical' incontinentia pigmenti. Sporadic incontinentia pigmenti, the so-called IP1, which maps to Xp11, is categorized as hypomelanosis of Ito (300337). <br>

It is characterized by frequent tonic seizures or spasms beginning in infancy with a specific EEG finding of suppression-burst patterns, characterized by high-voltage bursts alternating with almost flat suppression phases. Approximately 75% of EIEE patients progress to 'West syndrome,' which is characterized by tonic spasms with clustering, arrest of psychomotor development, and hypsarrhythmia on EEG (Kato et al, 2007). Deprez et al.

These disorders, including frontometaphyseal dysplasia (FMD; 305620), otopalatodigital syndrome-1 (OPD1; 311300), and otopalatodigital syndrome-2 (OPD2; 304120), constitute a phenotypic spectrum. At the mild end of the spectrum, males with OPD1 have cleft palate and mild skeletal anomalies with conductive deafness caused by ossicular anomalies. FMD is characterized by a generalized skeletal dysplasia, deafness and urogenital defects. Males with OPD2 have disabling skeletal anomalies in addition to variable malformations in the hindbrain, heart, intestines, and kidneys that frequently lead to perinatal death. The most severe phenotype, MNS, is characterized by a skeletal dysplasia in the heterozygote. Affected males exhibit severe malformations similar to those observed in individuals with OPD2, resulting in prenatal lethality or death in the first few months of life (review by Robertson, 2005).

309850=><br> Two monoamine oxidase (EC 1.4.3.4) isoenzymes, MAOA and MAOB (309860), are closely linked in opposite orientation on the X chromosome and are expressed in the outer mitochondrial membrane. MAOA and MAOB oxidize neurotransmitters and dietary amines, the regulation of which is important in maintaining normal mental states. MAOA prefers serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine as substrates, whereas MAOB prefers phenylethylamine. Low levels of MAO activity and mutations in the MAOA gene have been associated with violent, criminal, or impulsive behavior (Chen et al., 2004). <br>

Two monoamine oxidase (EC 1.4.3.4) isoenzymes, MAOA (309850) and MAOB, catalyze the oxidative deamination of neuroactive and vasoactive amines, as well as the oxidation of several xenobiotics. MAOA and MAOB are present in the outer mitochondrial membrane in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. MAOA, the primary type in fibroblasts, preferentially degrades serotonin and norepinephrine. MAOB, the primary type found in platelets and leukocytes, preferentially degrades phenylethylamine and benzylamine (summary by Bach et al., 1988). <br>

Mapping and molecular genetic studies indicate that both are the result of mutations in the huge gene that encodes dystrophin, also symbolized DMD. Approximately two-thirds of the mutations in both forms are deletions of one or many exons in the dystrophin gene. Although there is no clear correlation found between the extent of the deletion and the severity of the disorder, DMD deletions usually result in frameshift. Boland et al. (1996) studied a retrospective cohort of 33 male patients born between 1953 and 1983. The mean age at DMD diagnosis was 4.6 years; wheelchair dependency had a median age of 10 years; cardiac muscle failure developed in 15% of patients with a median age of 21.5 years; smooth muscle dysfunction in the digestive or urinary tract occurred in 21% and 6% of the patients, respectively, at a median age of 15 years. In this cohort, death occurred at a median age of 17 years. The authors commented that the diagnosis of DMD is being made at an earlier age but survival has not changed. <br>

Flexion deformities of the elbows dating from early childhood, mild pectus excavatum, signs of cardiac involvement and absence of muscle pseudohypertrophy, involvement of the forearm muscles, and mental retardation distinguish the Emery-Dreifuss form (EDMD1) from the Becker form (300376). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy <br> An autosomal dominant form of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, EDMD2 (181350), is caused by mutation in the lamin A/C gene (LMNA; 150330); a possible autosomal recessive form of the disorder that lacks cardiac features (EDMD3; see 181350) may be caused by mutation in the LMNA gene (150330.0014). Additional autosomal dominant forms include EDMD4 (612998), caused by mutation in the SYNE1 gene (608441), and EDMD5 (612999), caused by mutation in the SYNE2 gene (608442).

CSNB can be classified into 2 groups based on electroretinography (ERG) findings: the Schubert-Bornschein type is characterized by an ERG in which the b-wave is smaller than the a-wave, whereas the Riggs type is defined by proportionally reduced a- and b-waves. In addition, Schubert-Bornschein CSNB is associated with decreased visual acuity, myopia, and nystagmus, whereas in Riggs CSNB patients have visual acuity within the normal range and no symptoms of myopia and/or nystagmus (summary by Riazuddin et al., 2010). Additionally, Schubert-Bornschein CSNB can be subdivided into 'complete' and 'incomplete' forms (summary by Riazuddin et al., 2010). <br> Van Genderen et al. (2009) noted that standard flash ERG distinguishes a 'complete' form, also known as type 1 CSNB, from an 'incomplete' form, also known as type 2 CSNB (see CSNB2A, 300071). The complete form is characterized by the complete absence of rod pathway function, whereas the incomplete form is due to impaired rod and cone pathway function. Complete CSNB results from postsynaptic defects in depolarizing or ON bipolar cell signaling, whereas the hyperpolarizing or OFF bipolar cell pathway is intact. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Congenital Stationary Night Blindness <br> Autosomal recessive forms of complete CSNB have been reported: CSNB1B (257270), caused by mutation in the GRM6 gene (604096); CSNB1C (613216), caused by mutation in the TRPM1 gene (603576); and CSNB1D (613830), caused by mutation in the SLC24A1 gene (603617). <br> Autosomal dominant forms of complete CSNB that have been reported include CSNBAD1 (610445), caused by mutation in the RHO gene (180380); CSNBAD2 (163500), caused by mutation in the PDE6B gene (180072); and CSNBAD3 (610444), caused by mutation in the GNAT1 gene (139330). <br> In addition, X-linked and autosomal recessive forms of incomplete CSNB have been reported: CSNB2A (300071), caused by mutation in the CACNA1F gene (300110); and CSNB2B (610427), caused by mutation in the CABP4 gene (608965). <br>
310600=><br> Norrie disease is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by very early childhood blindness due to degenerative and proliferative changes of the neuroretina. Approximately 50% of patients show some form of progressive mental disorder, often with psychotic features, and about one-third of patients develop sensorineural deafness in the second decade. In addition, some patients have more complex phenotypes, including growth failure and seizures (Berger et al., 1992). <br> Warburg (1966) noted confusion of the terms 'pseudoglioma' and microphthalmia with Norrie disease in the literature. 'Pseudoglioma' is a nonspecific term for any condition resembling retinoblastoma and can have diverse causes, including inflammation, hemorrhage, trauma, neoplasia, or congenital malformation, and often shows unilateral involvement. Thus, 'pseudoglioma' is not an acceptable clinical or pathologic diagnosis (Duke-Elder, 1958). <br>

310700=><br> Classic congenital or infantile nystagmus presents as conjugate, horizontal oscillations of the eyes, in primary or eccentric gaze, often with a preferred head turn or tilt. Other associated features may include mildly decreased visual acuity, strabismus, astigmatism, and occasionally head nodding. Eye movement recordings reveal that infantile nystagmus is predominantly a horizontal jerk waveform, with a diagnostic accelerating velocity slow phase. However, pendular and triangular waveforms may also be present. The nystagmus may rarely be vertical. As these patients often have normal visual acuity, it is presumed that the nystagmus represents a primary defect in the parts of the brain responsible for ocular motor control; thus the disorder has sometimes been termed 'congenital motor nystagmus' (Tarpey et al., 2006; Shiels et al., 2007). <br>

Although these clinical features overlap those reported in other forms of orofaciodigital syndrome, OFD1 can be easily distinguished from among these by its X-linked dominant inheritance pattern and by polycystic kidney disease, which seems to be specific to type I. <br> Since the CXORF5 gene localizes to the centrosome and basal body of primary cilia, OFD1 is considered to be a ciliopathy (Chetty-John et al., 2010). <br>

The disorder is treatable with supplemental dietary arginine and low protein diet. <br> Urea cycle disorders are characterized by the triad of hyperammonemia, encephalopathy, and respiratory alkalosis. Five disorders involving different defects in the biosynthesis of the enzymes of the urea cycle have been described: OTC deficiency, carbamyl phosphate synthetase deficiency (237300), argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency, or citrullinemia (215700), argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (207900), and arginase deficiency (207800). <br>

311300=><br> Otopalatodigital syndrome-1 is 1 of 4 otopalatodigital syndromes caused by mutations in the FLNA gene. The disorders, which include frontometaphyseal dysplasia (FMD; 305620), otopalatodigital syndrome-2 (OPD2; 304120), and Melnick-Needles syndrome (MNS; 309350), constitute a phenotypic spectrum. At the mild end of the spectrum, males with OPD1 have cleft palate and mild skeletal anomalies with conductive deafness caused by ossicular anomalies. FMD is characterized by a generalized skeletal dysplasia, deafness and urogenital defects. Males with OPD2 have disabling skeletal anomalies in addition to variable malformations in the hindbrain, heart, intestines, and kidneys that frequently lead to perinatal death. The most severe phenotype, MNS, is characterized by a skeletal dysplasia in the heterozygote. Affected males exhibit severe malformations similar to those observed in individuals with OPD2, resulting in prenatal lethality or death in the first few months of life (review by Robertson, 2005). Verloes et al. (2000) suggested that these disorders constitute a single entity, which they termed 'frontootopalatodigital osteodysplasia.' <br>

311770=><br> Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) is a glycolipid that attaches dozens of different proteins to the cell surface. GPI is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transferred to the C termini of proteins with GPI attachment signal peptides. The common core structure of GPI consists of a molecule of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and a glycan core that contains glucosamine, 3 mannoses, and an ethanolamine phosphate. Biosynthesis of GPI anchors involves at least 10 reactions and more than 20 different genes. PIGA is 1 of 7 proteins required for the first step of GPI anchor biosynthesis, the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from uridine 5-prime-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamide (UDP-GlcNAc) to PI to yield GlcNAc-PI (review by Brodsky, 2008). <br>

X-linked PDH deficiency is one of the few X-linked diseases in which a high proportion of heterozygous females manifest severe symptoms. The clinical spectrum of PDH deficiency is broad, ranging from fatal lactic acidosis in the newborn to chronic neurologic dysfunction with structural abnormalities in the CNS without systemic acidosis (Robinson et al., 1987; Brown et al., 1994). <br> PDH deficiency can also be caused by mutation in other subunits of the PDH complex, including a form (248600) caused by mutation in the E3 gene (DLD; 238331) on chromosome 7q, and a form (245349) caused by mutation in the component X gene (PDHX; 608769) on chromosome 11p. Mutation in the PDHB gene (179060) encoding the E1-beta protein or the DLAT gene (608770) encoding the E2 protein can also cause PDH deficiency.

313650=><br> Transcription factor IID (TFIID) is a DNA-binding protein complex required for RNA polymerase II (see POLR2A; 180660)-mediated transcription of many, if not all, protein-encoding genes in eukaryotic cells. Other general transcription factors are TFIIA (600519, 600520), TFIIB (189963), TFIIE (189962, 189964), TFIIF (189968), TFIIG/J, and TFIIH (189972). TFIID plays a key role in initiation, since it binds to the TATA element to form a complex that nucleates the assembly of the other components into a preinitiation complex and that may be stable through multiple rounds of transcription. TAF1, or TAFII250, is the largest subunit of TFIID. Other protein subunits of TFIID include TATA box-binding protein (TBP; 600075) and numerous other TBP-associated factors (TAFs; see 600475).

500000=><br> Histiocytoid cardiomyopathy, which was initially described by Voth (1962), goes by various names, including infantile xanthomatous cardiomyopathy (MacMahon, 1971), focal lipid cardiomyopathy (Bove and Schwartz, 1973), oncocytic cardiomyopathy (Silver et al., 1980), infantile cardiomyopathy with histiocytoid change (Ferrans et al., 1976), and foamy myocardial transformation of infancy (Yatani et al., 1988). The disorder is a rare but distinctive entity of infancy and childhood characterized by the presence of characteristic pale granular foamy histiocyte-like cells within the myocardium. It usually affects children younger than 2 years of age, with a clear predominance of females over males. Infants present with dysrhythmia or cardiac arrest, and the clinical course is usually fulminant, sometimes simulating sudden infant death syndrome (Andreu et al., 2000). <br>

Matrilineal relatives within and among families carrying certain pathogenic mitochondrial mutations exhibit a wide range of penetrance, severity, and age of onset of hearing loss, indicating that the mitochondrial mutations by themselves are not sufficient to produce a deafness phenotype.

516000=><br> Subunit 1 is one of 7 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded subunits (MTND1, MTND2, MTND3, MTND4, MTND4L, MTND5, MTND6) included among the approximately 41 polypeptides of respiratory Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.5.3)(Shoffner and Wallace, 1995; Arizmendi et al., 1992; Walker et al., 1992; Anderson et al., 1981; Attardi et al., 1986; Chomyn et al., 1985, 1986; Wallace et al., 1986; Oliver and Wallace, 1982; Wallace et al., 1994). <br> Complex I is the first step in the electron transport chain of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and is located within the mitochondrial inner membrane. It accepts electrons from NADH and transfers them, through a series of electron carriers, to ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10). The internal electron carriers of complex I include flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and 6 iron-sulfur clusters designated N-1a, N-1b, N-2, N-3, N-4, and N-5 (Ohnishi, 1979; Ragan, 1987). Complex I can be subdivided into 3 main fractions: the flavoprotein fragment, the iron-protein fragment, and the hydrophobic protein fragment (Ragan, 1987). The flavoprotein fragment contains the FMN, 6 of the iron atoms, and 3 polypeptides (51, 24, and 10 kD) (Galante and Hatefi, 1979; Ragan et al., 1982). The NADH-binding site and FMN have been assigned to the 51-kD polypeptide (Chen and Guillory, 1981). The iron-protein fragment contains 9 or 10 iron atoms (Ragan et al., 1982), and a 15-kD protein from this fragment appears to be the ubiquinone-binding protein involved in electron transfer to ubiquinone (Suzuki and Ozawa, 1986). The MTND6 protein may also be located in the iron-protein fragment (Chomyn et al., 1986). The hydrophobic protein fragment contains the iron-sulfur centers that are the likely electron donors to ubiquinone (Ohnishi et al., 1985; Ohnishi et al., 1974). Of the 7 mitochondrial DNA Complex I genes, the gene products for MTND1, MTND3, and MTND4L have been localized to the hydrophobic protein fragment (Ragan, 1987), and the MTND2, MTND4, and MTND5 gene products probably reside there also. <br> The MTND1 polypeptide binds rotenone and rotenone analogs, and rotenone is thought to interact with the ubiquinone binding site. Hence, MTND1 might be involved in electron transfer to ubiquinone (Ragan, 1987; Earley and Ragan, 1984). However, studies on erythrosine-5-prime-iodoacetamide binding suggest that the rotenone and ubiquinone binding sites may not be identical (Ahmed and Krishnamoorthy, 1992). <br>
516001=><br> Subunit 2 of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I) is 1 of 7 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded subunits (MTND1, MTND2, MTND3, MTND4, MTND4L, MTND5, MTND6) included among the approximately 41 polypeptides of respiratory Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.5.3) (Shoffner and Wallace, 1995; Arizmendi et al., 1992; Walker et al., 1992; Anderson et al., 1981; Attardi et al., 1986; Chomyn et al., 1985; Wallace et al., 1986; Oliver and Wallace, 1982; Wallace et al., 1994). Complex I accepts electrons from NADH, transfers them to ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10), and uses the energy released to pump protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Complex I is more fully described under 516000. MTND2 is probably a component of the hydrophobic protein fragment of the complex (Ragan, 1987). <br>
516002=><br> Subunit 3 is 1 of 7 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded subunits (MTND1, MTND2, MTND3, MTND4, MTND4L, MTND5, MTND6) included among the approximately 41 polypeptides of respiratory Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.5.3) (Shoffner and Wallace, 1995; Arizmendi et al., 1992; Walker et al., 1992; Anderson et al., 1981; Attardi et al., 1986; Chomyn et al., 1985, 1986; Wallace et al., 1986; Oliver and Wallace, 1982; Wallace et al., 1994). Complex I accepts electron from NADH, transfers them to ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10) and uses the energy released to pump protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Complex I is more fully described under 516000. MTND3 has been localized to the hydrophobic protein fragment of the Complex (Ragan, 1987). <br>

Complex I accepts electrons from NADH, transfers them to ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10) and uses the energy released to pump protons out across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Complex I is more fully described in 516000. MTND4 is probably a component of the hydrophobic protein fragment (Ragan, 1987). <br>
516004=><br> Subunit 4L is 1 of the 7 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded subunits (MTND1, MTND2, MTND3, MTND4, MTND4L, MTND5, MTND6) included among the approximately 41 polypeptides of respiratory Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.5.3) (Shoffner and Wallace, 1995; Arizmendi et al., 1992; Walker et al., 1992; Anderson et al., 1981; Attardi et al., 1986; Chomyn et al., 1985, 1986; Wallace et al., 1986; Oliver and Wallace, 1982; Wallace et al., 1994). Complex I accepts electrons from NADH, transfers them to ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10), and uses the energy released to pump protons out across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Complex I is more fully described under 516000. MTND4L is probably a component of the hydrophobic protein fragment of the complex (Ragan, 1987). <br>
516005=><br> Subunit 5 is 1 of the 7 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded subunits (MTND1, MTND2, MTND3, MTND4L, MTND4, MTND5, MTND6) included among the approximately 41 polypeptides of respiratory complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.5.3)(Shoffner and Wallace, 1995; Arizmendi et al., 1992; Walker et al., 1992; Anderson et al., 1981; Attardi et al., 1986; Chomyn et al., 1985, 1986; Wallace et al., 1986; Oliver and Wallace, 1982; Wallace et al., 1994). Complex I accepts electron from NADH, transfers them to ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10) and uses the energy released to pump protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Complex I is more fully described under 516000. MTND5 is probably a component of the hydrophobic protein fragment (Ragan, 1987). <br>
516006=><br> Subunit 6 is 1 of the 7 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded subunits (MTND1, MTND2, MTND3, MTND4L, MTND4, MTND5, MTND6) included among the approximately 41 polypeptides of respiratory Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.5.3) (Shoffner and Wallace, 1995; Arizmendi et al., 1992; Walker et al., 1992; Anderson et al., 1981; Attardi et al., 1986; Chomyn et al., 1985, 1986; Wallace et al., 1986; Oliver and Wallace, 1982; Wallace et al., 1994). Complex I accepts electrons from NADH, transfers them to ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10), and uses the energy released to pump protons across the mitochondria inner membrane. Complex I is more fully described under 516000. MTND6 has been proposed to be a component of the iron-protein fragment (Chomyn et al., 1986). <br> The predicted polypeptide has a molecular weight of 18.6 kD (Anderson et al., 1981). However, its apparent MW on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (PAGE) using Tris-glycine buffer is 16.7 kD (Oliver et al., 1984; Oliver and Wallace, 1982; Wallace et al., 1986), and the apparent MW on urea-phosphate gels is also close to the predicted molecular weight (Chomyn et al., 1986). <br>
516020=><br> Cytochrome b (MTCYB) is the only mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded subunit of respiratory Complex III (ubiquinol:ferrocytochrome c oxidoreductase, or cytochrome bc1, complex, EC 1.10.2.2). Complex III is located within the mitochondrial inner membrane and is the second enzyme in the electron transport chain of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. It catalyzes the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol (reduced Coenzyme Q10) to cytochrome c and utilizes the energy to translocate protons from inside the mitochondrial inner membrane to outside. Bovine Complex III has been resolved into 11 polypeptides by SDS-polyacrylamide gels (PAGE), designated I-XI (Schagger et al., 1986; Gonzalez-Halphen et al., 1988). These subunits include core proteins I and II, cytochrome b (subunit III), cytochrome c1 (subunit IV), the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (subunit V), and several smaller polypeptides. Subunits III, IV, and V are the major redox proteins in the complex and are present in the molar ratio 2:1:1 (Rieske, 1976). The core proteins I and II are essential for the assembly and proper association of the redox centers in Complex III, though they do not contain redox centers (Linke and Weiss, 1986; Crivellone et al., 1988; Oudshoorn et al., 1987; Tzagoloff et al., 1986). <br> MTCYB is a highly evolutionarily conserved, hydrophobic protein containing 8 or 9 transmembrane domains and 2 heme groups. The 2 hemes differ in redox potential and difference spectra and have been designated b-562--the high potential heme, and b-566--the low potential heme (Esposti et al., 1993; Wikstrom et al., 1981; Saraste, 1984). Cytochrome b together with core proteins I and II comprise the central components of Complex III. The Rieske iron-sulfur protein is on the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane and accepts electrons from MTCYB (Gonzalez-Halphen et al., 1988). The electrons are then transferred to cytochrome c1 which contains 1 membrane-spanning domain, a covalently bound heme, and is also located on the outside of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Cytochrome c1 transfers electrons to cytochrome c (Weiss et al., 1987). <br> The mechanism by which proton translocation is linked to electron transport has been studied intensively for Complex III. Two important models are the proton-motive ubiquinone (Q) cycle and the b-cycle (Mitchell, 1976; Hatefi, 1985). Both models link proton translocation and electron transfer through ubiquinone redox intermediates (Hatefi, 1985; Wikstrom and Krab, 1986). <br>
516030=><br> Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CO1 or MTCO1) is 1 of 3 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded subunits (MTCO1, MTCO2, MTCO3) of respiratory Complex IV. Complex IV is located within the mitochondrial inner membrane and is the third and final enzyme of the electron transport chain of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. It collects electrons from reduced cytochrome c and transfers them to oxygen to give water. The energy released is used to transport protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Complex IV is composed of 13 polypeptides. Subunits I, II, and III (MTCO1, MTCO2, MTCO3) are encoded by mtDNA while subunits IV, Va, Vb, VIa, VIb, VIc, VIIa, VIIb, VIIc, and VIII are nuclear encoded (Kadenbach et al., 1983; Shoffner and Wallace, 1995). While the mammalian Complex IV has a complex structure, several prokaryotic enzyme systems have the same catalytic functions, but are much simpler. These systems have been amenable to cloning and in vitro mutagenesis permitting detailed structure-function studies. Two well-studied systems are the cytochrome aa3 (cytochrome c oxidase) of Rhodobacter sphaeroides and the cytochrome bo (ubiquinol oxidase) of Escherichia coli. The R. sphaeroides enzyme has 3 subunits that are homologous to the 3 mammalian mtDNA subunits. R. sphaeroides subunit I is 62.1 kD and 52% identical and 76% similar to beef heart MTCO1; subunit II is 32.9 kD and 39% identical and 63% similar to beef MTCO2, and subunit III is 30.1 kD and 49% identical and 71% similar to beef heart. The Soret maxred = 444.5 nm (bovine = 443 nm) and alpha-band maxred = 606 nm (bovine = 604 nm). The extinction coefficients are identical (Hosler et al., 1993). These and other studies (Capaldi, 1990) have generated the following functional outlines for this enzyme. <br> The cytochrome c oxidase family of enzymes have 4 redox centers, 2 hemes and 2 copper centers. In mitochondrial Complex IV, the 2 hemes are a and a3 and the 2 coppers are CuA and CuB. The 2 hemes and CuB are bound to subunit I. For R. sphaeroides subunit I and for mammalian MTCO1, there are 12 membrane-spanning alpha-helices (I to XII). Of these helices, heme a is located between helix II and X, ligated with the invariant histidines at amino acid 102 (MTCO1 88) of helix II and at 421 (MTCO1 378) of helix X. Helix X lies between heme a and heme a3, with heme a3 bound to the opposite side of helix X at invariant histidine at amino acid 419 (MTCO1 376). Heme a3 is a component of a binuclear center which includes CuB and where oxygen is reduced to water. CuB is thought to lie adjacent to the iron of heme a3 and to be ligated to helix VI through invariant histidine 284 (MTCO1 240) and to helix VII through invariant histidines 333 and 334 (MTCO1 290 and 291). Amino acids histidine 411 (MTCO1 368), aspartate 412 (369), threonine 413 (370), and tyrosine 414 (371) occur in the conserved loop between helices IX and X, lying close to hemes a and a3, and may be in the proximity of the CuA located in subunit II (Hosler et al., 1993). <br> Subunit II of Complex IV interacts with cytochrome c and contains the CuA center. This means that the pathway of electron transfer through Complex IV is from cytochrome c, to CuA, to cytochrome a, and then to the binuclear center of cytochrome a3-CuB. It is thought that the transfer of electrons from cytochrome a to the binuclear center is the key control point in the reaction and one of the major points of energy transduction (Hill, 1993). <br> Proton translocation in Complex IV involves four electrons to reduce O2 and four protons taken up from the matrix side of the mitochondrial membrane for the formation of H2O. Four more protons are vertically translocated from the matrix to the cytosol side of the membrane. Evidence is accumulating that proton translocation is linked to electron transfer at the binuclear oxygen (O2) binding site, which has been extended to suggest that proton translocation is associated with proximal ligand exchange between tyrosine and histidine on cytochrome a3 (Rousseau et al., 1993). <br> The toxicity of classical inhibitors of Complex IV is the result of drug interaction with these reactive sites. Cyanide and azide form a bridge between cytochrome a3 and CuB. Thiocyanate and formate bind elsewhere on the binuclear center, probably at CuB (Palmer, 1993). <br> Subunit III is an universal component of cytochrome c oxidase. Previously, it was thought to participate in proton translocation because dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), a inhibitor of proton transport in other systems, binds to the glutamate at position 90 in subunit III (Prochaska et al., 1981). However, more recent studies place this function at the binuclear center in subunit I. Hence, the function of subunit III remains unclear. <br> The functions of the 10 nuclear encoded Complex IV subunits is just beginning to be elucidated. Three of the subunits, VIa, VIIa, and VIII, have two isoforms, one expressed in heart and skeletal muscle and the other in the remaining tissues (Capaldi, 1990; Lomax and Grossman, 1989). The differential expression of this genes is in part the product of differential transcription (Wallace, 1993). <br>
516040=><br> Cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COII or MTCO2) is 1 of 3 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded subunits (MTCO1, MTCO2, MTCO3) of respiratory Complex IV. Complex IV is located within the mitochondrial inner membrane and is the third and final enzyme of the electron transport chain of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. It collects electrons from ferrocytochrome c (reduced cytochrome c) and transfers them to oxygen to give water. The energy released is used to transport protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Complex IV is composed of 13 polypeptides. Subunits I, II and III (MTCO1, MTCO2, MTCO3) are encoded by the mtDNA while subunits IV, Va, Vb, VIa, VIb, VIc, VIIa, VIIb, VIIc, and VIII are nuclear encoded (Kadenbach et al., 1983; Capaldi, 1990; Shoffner and Wallace, 1995). Subunits VIa, VIIa, and VIII have systemic as well as heart-muscle isoforms (Capaldi, 1990; Lomax and Grossman, 1989). <br> Subunit II contains one redox center, CuA, and collects electrons from ferrocytochrome b. The electrons are then transferred to cytochrome a of subunit I and on to the cytochrome a3-CuB binuclear reaction center. CuA most likely resides in a loop containing conserved cysteines at amino acids 196 and 200 and a conserved histidine at 204, with the fourth ligand being histidine 161. Cytochrome c interacts with subunit II through the association of a ring of lysines around the heme edge of cytochrome c with carboxyls in subunit II, specifically glutamate 129, aspartate 132, and glutamate 198 (Hill, 1993; Capaldi, 1990). <br> The predicted molecular weight (MW) of MTCO2 is 25.5 kD (Anderson et al., 1981; Wallace et al., 1994). However, its apparent MW on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (PAGE) is 23.6 kD using Tris-glycine buffer (Oliver et al., 1984; Oliver and Wallace, 1982; Wallace et al., 1986), whereas it is 20 kD when using urea-phosphate buffer (Ching and Attardi, 1982; Hare et al., 1980). <br>

The first 17 of these variants are summarized in Table M1, MIM12. <br> As pointed out by Riordan-Eva and Harding (1995), although the plethora of mtDNA mutations identified in families with LHON had resulted in confusion as to the pathogenic significance of each mutation, it had been established that the 3 primary mutations at basepairs 11778 (516003.0001), 3460 (516000.0001), and 14484 (516006.0001) are present in at least 90% of families. The correlation between the 14484 mutation and a good visual prognosis provides not only hope for affected patients, but also an approach for further research into the pathogenesis of LHON. <br> Yu-Wai-Man et al.

YY1 exerts its effects on genes involved in these processes via its ability to initiate, activate, or repress transcription depending upon the context in which it binds. Mechanisms of YY1 action include direct activation or repression, indirect activation or repression via cofactor recruitment, or activation or repression by disruption of binding sites or conformational DNA changes (review by Gordon et al., 2006). <br>

600018=><br> The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for the most commonly used opioids, including morphine, heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. It is also the primary receptor for endogenous opioid peptides beta-endorphin (see POMC, 176830) and the enkephalins (see PENK, 131330). The OPRM1 receptor is a membrane of the G protein-coupled receptor family (Bond et al., 1998). There are at least 3 types of opioid receptors, mu, kappa (OPRK1; 165196), and delta (OPRD1; 165195), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile (Chen et al., 1993). <br>

MXI1 and MAD may antagonize MYC function and are candidate tumor suppressor genes (Edelhoff et al., 1994). <br>
600021=><br> The MAD and MXI1 (600020) genes encode proteins that belong to a distinct subfamily of MAX (154950)-interacting proteins. The MAX protein specifically interacts with the MYC protein family (190080) by forming heterodimers mediated by their basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZ) interaction domains. Binding to MAX is essential for MYC transcription and transforming activity; MYC homodimers are inactive. Both MAD and MXI1 bind MAX in vitro, forming a sequence-specific DNA-binding complex similar to the MYC-MAX heterodimer. MAD and MYC compete for binding to MAX. In addition, MAD acts as a transcriptional repressor, while MYC appears to function as an activator. MXI1 also appears to lack a transcriptional activation domain. Therefore, MXI1 and MAD might antagonize MYC function and are candidate tumor suppressor genes. <br>
600022=><br> Prostacyclin (also known as prostaglandin I2 or PGI2) is a labile metabolite of arachidonic acid produced in concert with the bis-enoic prostaglandins via the cyclooxygenase pathway. PGI2 plays a major physiologic role as a potent mediator of vasodilation and inhibitor of platelet activation. Thus, PGI2 causes relaxation of arterial smooth muscle and inhibition of platelet aggregation, degranulation, and shape change, and is therefore thought to be important in maintaining vascular homeostasis. The actions of PGI2 are mediated via specific cell surface IP receptors, members of the G protein-coupled receptor gene superfamily, which upon activation cause an elevation in intracellular cAMP via direct stimulation of adenylate cyclase. The distribution of IP receptors mirrors the physiologic actions of PGI2. Prostanoid receptors of the EP1 (176802), EP2 (176804), EP3 (176806), and EP4 (601586) types cloned in the mouse and/or human were reviewed by Coleman et al. (1994). <br>
600023=><br> Cadherins, such as CDH11, are cell surface glycoproteins that mediate Ca(2+)-dependent cell-cell adhesion. These proteins have a molecular mass of about 120 kD and are composed of an extracellular domain at the N-terminal end and a relatively small cytoplasmic domain at the C-terminal end; the 2 domains are connected by a single membrane-spanning sequence. The extracellular domain consists of 5 subdomains, each of which contains a cadherin-specific motif. Cadherin expression is regulated spatially as well as temporally. Cadherins are thought to play an important role in development and maintenance of tissues through selective cell-cell adhesion activity and may be involved also in the invasion and metastasis of malignant tumors (Tanihara et al., 1994). <br>
600024=><br> The LBR gene encodes the lamin B receptor, an inner nuclear membrane protein that binds lamin B (LMNB1; 150340 and LMNB2; 150341). The nuclear envelope is composed of the nuclear lamina, the nuclear pore complexes, and the nuclear membranes. The nuclear membranes can be divided into 3 morphologically distinct but interconnected domains: the outer nuclear membrane, the inner nuclear membrane, and the nuclear pore membrane. The inner nuclear membrane is adjacent to the nuclear lamina, a meshwork of intermediate filament proteins termed lamins. The nuclear lamina is a discontinuous structure that occupies only a fraction of the nuclear periphery, and at some points, the inner nuclear membrane may interact directly with the chromatin. Several integral proteins of the nuclear envelope inner membrane that may be associated with the lamina and the chromatin have been identified. (summary by Ye and Worman, 1994). <br>

BEEC is one of the most severe urologic birth defects because of its profound impact on continence, sexual function, and morbidity due to the effect of chronic and recurrent infections on renal function. The term 'exstrophy,' derived from the Greek work ekstriphein, which literally means 'turn inside out,' was first used by Chaussier in 1780. <br> Martinez-Frias et al. (2001) emphasized that exstrophy of the cloaca and exstrophy of the bladder are 2 different expressions of a primary developmental field defect. Cloacal exstrophy is a feature of the OEIS (omphalocele-exstrophy-imperforate anus-spinal defects) complex (258040). Exstrophy of the cloaca includes the persistence and exstrophy of a common cloaca that receives ureters, ileum, and a rudimentary hindgut and is associated with failure of fusion of the genital tubercles and pubic rami, incomplete development of the lumbosacral vertebrae with spinal dysraphism, imperforate anus, cryptorchidism and epispadias in males and anomalies of the mullerian duct derivatives in females, and a wide range of urinary tract anomalies.

(2001) described the assembly of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) complex in normal and repair-deficient (xeroderma pigmentosum) human cells by employing a novel technique of local ultraviolet irradiation combined with fluorescent antibody labeling. The damage-recognition complex XPC (613208)-HHR23B (RAD23B) appeared to be essential for the recruitment of all subsequent NER factors in the preincision complex, including transcription repair factor TFIIH (see 189972). Volker et al. (2001) found that XPA (611153) associates relatively late, is required for anchoring of ERCC1 (126380)-XPF (133520), and may be essential for activation of the endonuclease activity of XPG (133530). These findings identified XPC as the earliest known NER factor in the reaction mechanism, gave insight into the order of subsequent NER components, provided evidence for a dual role of XPA, and supported a concept of sequential assembly of repair proteins at the site of damage rather than a preassembled repairosome. The XPC-RAD23B complex is specifically involved in global genome but not transcription-coupled NER. <br>

600072=><br> Fatal familial insomnia is a prion disorder showing autosomal dominant inheritance. It is clinically characterized by insomnia with or without a diurnal dreaming state, hallucinations, delirium, and dysautonomia preceding motor and cognitive deterioration. FFI is specifically associated with the asp178-to-asn mutation of the PRNP gene (D178N; 176640.0010) when the amino acid at position 129 is methionine (M129V; 176640.0005). The D178N mutation and the val129 allele results in Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD; 123400) (see 176640.0007) (Goldfarb et al., 1992). CJD typically presents with dementia, ataxia, myoclonus, and other abnormal movements; however, there is considerable clinical and pathologic overlap between FFI and CJD, and some individuals with D178N and met129 may present with a phenotype suggestive of CJD. Thus, FFI and CJD may be viewed as extremes of a phenotypic spectrum (summary by Zarranz et al., 2005). <br>

In addition, tensin can bind to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins and can itself be phosphorylated, suggesting that tensin may be a link between the cytoskeleton and a signal transduction pathway. Tensin phosphorylation occurs during cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins. <br>

Such signaling is critical for the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and neoplastic transformation. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins can be specifically dephosphorylated through the action of PTPs, which therefore are likely to have as important a role as PTKs in the control of cellular growth and differentiation (summary by Takekawa et al., 1992) <br>

In humans, apoB-100 is synthesized in the liver and is present in very low density lipoproteins and their metabolic products. On the other hand, apoB-48 is synthesized in the small intestine and is the form of apoB present in chylomicrons and chylomicron remnants. The biogenesis of apoB-48 is unique in that apoB-100 and apoB-48 are products of the same gene, APOB (107730). ApoB-48 mRNA is produced from apoB-100 mRNA by RNA editing. A C-to-U conversion of the first base of codon 2153, which encodes glutamine, changes it from CAA to UAA, an in-frame stop codon (Hodges and Scott, 1992; Chan, 1993). ApoB-48 contains 2,152 amino acids, compared to 4,536 residues in apoB-100. The apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing protein (APOBEC1) is involved in the production of apoB-48 from apoB-100. <br>

DUSP3 contains the consensus DUSP C-terminal catalytic domain but lacks the N-terminal CH2 domain found in the MKP (mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase) class of DUSPs (see 600714).

The complex extracellular domain and the fact that the expression of this receptor tyrosine kinase is restricted to the endothelial cell lineage suggest that TEK plays a unique role within this cell lineage. In fact, disruption of the TEK gene by homologous recombination in ES cells results in embryonic lethality in homozygous mutant mouse embryos due to deficiency of the endothelium.

The result is a stable, insoluble macromolecular structure, a process used widely throughout the plant and animal kingdoms. The human haploid genome contains at least 5 distinct transglutaminases that are differentially expressed in time-space and tissue-specific ways. These include the catalytic subunit of factor XIII (134570); band 4.2 (177070), an inactive enzyme that forms a part of the subplasma membrane of erythrocytic and other cells; transglutaminase-1 (TGM1; 190195), a membrane-associated enzyme present in many epithelial as well as some nonepithelial tissues; a ubiquitously expressed tissue transglutaminase-2 (TGM2; 190196); and a proenzyme activity, transglutaminase-3, found in terminally differentiating epidermal and hair keratinocytes. This proenzyme requires activation by proteolysis. The TGM1 and TGM3 enzymes are thought to be involved in the formation of the cornified cell envelope (CE) of the epidermis, hair follicle, and perhaps other stratified squamous epithelia by cross-linking of CE protein constituents with isodipeptide bonds (Kim et al., (1993)). <br>

Two isoforms of PTGS have been identified: PTGS1 (COX1; 176805) and a mitogen-inducible form, PTGS2. PTGS1 is involved in production of prostaglandins for cellular housekeeping functions, whereas PTGS2 is associated with biologic events such as injury, inflammation, and proliferation (summary by Hla and Neilson (1992) and Tazawa et al.

600274=><br> Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) refers to a clinical manifestation of the pathologic finding of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). FTD, the most common subtype of FTLD, is a behavioral variant characterized by changes in social and personal conduct with loss of volition, executive dysfunction, loss of abstract thought, and decreased speech output. A second clinical subtype of FTLD is 'semantic dementia,' characterized by specific loss of comprehension of language and impaired facial and object recognition. A third clinical subtype of FTLD is 'primary progressive aphasia' (PPA), characterized by a reduction in speech production, speech errors, and word retrieval difficulties resulting in mutism and an inability to communicate. All subtypes have relative preservation of memory, at least in the early stages. FTLD is often associated with parkinsonism or motor neuron disease (MND) resembling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; 105400) (reviews by Tolnay and Probst, 2002 and Mackenzie and Rademakers, 2007). Mackenzie et al. (2009, 2010) provided a classification of FTLD subtypes according to the neuropathologic findings (see PATHOGENESIS below). <br> - Clinical Variability of Tauopathies <br> Tauopathies comprise a clinically variable group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized neuropathologically by accumulation of abnormal MAPT-positive inclusions in nerve and/or glial cells. In addition to frontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia, and PPA, different clinical syndromes with overlapping features have been described, leading to confusion in the terminology (Tolnay and Probst, 2002). Other terms used historically include parkinsonism and dementia with pallidopontonigral degeneration (PPND) (Wszolek et al., 1992); disinhibition-dementia-parkinsonism-amyotrophy complex (DDPAC) (Lynch et al., 1994); frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism (FLDEM) (Yamaoka et al., 1996); and multiple system tauopathy with presenile dementia (MSTD) (Spillantini et al., 1997). These disorders are characterized by variable degrees of frontal lobe dementia, parkinsonism, motor neuron disease, and amyotrophy. <br> Other neurodegenerative associated with mutations in the MAPT gene include Pick disease (172700) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; 601104), <br> Inherited neurodegenerative tauopathies linked to chromosome 17 and caused by mutation in the MAPT gene have also been collectively termed 'FTDP17' (Lee et al., 2001). <br> Kertesz (2003) suggested the term 'Pick complex' to represent the overlapping syndromes of FTD, primary progressive aphasia (PPA), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), PSP, and FTD with motor neuron disease. He noted that frontotemporal dementia may also be referred to as 'clinical Pick disease' and that the term 'Pick disease' should be restricted to the pathologic finding of Pick bodies. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration <br> Mutations in several different genes can cause frontotemporal dementia and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with or without motor neuron disease. See FTLD with TDP43 inclusions (607485), caused by mutation in the GRN gene (138945) on chromosome 17q21; FTLD mapping to chromosome 3 (600795), caused by mutation in the CHMP2B gene (609512); inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease and FTD (IBMPFD; 167320), caused by mutation in the VCP gene (601023) on chromosome 9p13; ALS6 (608030), caused by mutation in the FUS gene (137070) on 16p11; ALS10 (612069), caused by mutation in the TARDBP gene (605078) on 1p36; and FTDMND (105550), which maps to chromosome 9p. <br> In 1 family with FTD, a mutation was identified in the presenilin-1 gene (PSEN1; 104311) on chromosome 14, which is usually associated with a familial form of early-onset Alzheimer disease (AD3; 607822). <br>
600275=><br> The NOTCH2 gene encodes a single pass transmembrane protein belonging to an evolutionarily conserved NOTCH receptor family (see, e.g., NOTCH1; 190198).

Its physiologic action is exerted through the activation of ligand-gated ion channels and G protein-coupled membrane receptors. Glutamate-gated ionic channels are broadly classified into N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA types. Three related non-NMDA receptor subunit gene families have been defined: the AMPA-preferring family, e.g., GLUR1 (138248), and the 2 kainate-preferring families. GRIK1 (138245), GRIK2 (138244), and GRIK3 (138243) constitute one of the GRIK gene families, and KA1 and KA2 (gene symbols, GRIK4 and GRIK5 (600283), respectively) constitute the second GRIK gene family. GRIK4 and GRIK5 form functional heteromeric kainate-preferring ionic channels with the subunits encoded by the GRIK1, GRIK2, and GRIK3 genes, but not with those falling in the AMP-preferring family (Szpirer et al., 1994). <br>

600285=><br> Termination of protein biosynthesis and release of the nascent polypeptide chain are signaled by the presence of an in-frame stop codon at the aminoacyl site of the ribosome. The process of translation termination is universal and is mediated by protein release factors (RFs) and GTP. A class 1 RF recognizes the stop codon and promotes the hydrolysis of the ester bond linking the polypeptide chain with the peptidyl site tRNA, a reaction catalyzed at the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome. Class 2 RFs, which are not codon specific and do not recognize codons, stimulate class 1 RF activity and confer GTP dependency upon the process. In prokaryotes, both class 1 RFs, RF1 and RF2, recognize UAA; however, UAG and UGA are decoded specifically by RF1 and RF2, respectively. In eukaryotes, eRF1, or ETF1, the functional counterpart of RF1 and RF2, functions as an omnipotent RF, decoding all 3 stop codons (Frolova et al., 1994). <br>

In its complete form there is an ostium primum atrial septal defect combined with a defect of the inlet portion of the ventricular septum, and the tricuspid and mitral valves are replaced by a single inlet valve which bridges across the whole inlet. The defect is a characteristic feature of Down syndrome due to trisomy 21 (190685) and is seen in other syndromes. The isolated form is associated with a high empiric recurrence risk and has been documented to be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with variable expression and incomplete penetrance.

These genes share more than 99% nucleotide identity, and both are capable of encoding a 294-amino acid RNA-binding protein, SMN, that is required for efficient assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes. Homozygous loss of the SMN1 gene causes spinal muscular atrophy (SMA; 253300). Absence of SMN1 is partially compensated for by SMN2, which produces enough SMN protein to allow for relatively normal development in cell types other than motor neurons. However, SMN2 cannot fully compensate for loss of SMN1 because, although SMN2 is transcribed at a level comparable to that of SMN1, a large majority of SMN2 transcripts lack exon 7, resulting in production of a truncated, less stable SMN protein (Lefebvre et al., 1995; Kashima et al., 2007). <br>

As members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, PPARs act by controlling networks of target genes. PPARs can be activated by both dietary fatty acids and their metabolic derivatives in the body, and thus serve as lipid sensors that, when activated, can markedly redirect metabolism. Whereas PPARA (170998) and PPARG (601487) are predominantly expressed in liver and adipose tissue, respectively, PPARD is abundantly expressed throughout the body, but at only low levels in liver. Consistent with their expression profiles, the PPARs each have unique functions in the regulation of energy metabolism. PPARD is a powerful regulator of fatty acid catabolism and energy homeostasis, with a broad role in fat burning (review by Evans et al., 2004). <br>

Analysis of the interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) promoter, which is activated rapidly after TCR stimulation, showed 2 homologous regions that bind a complex induced upon TCR stimulation and whose induction is inhibited by the immunosuppressant agents cyclosporin A and FK506. This DNA-binding complex was designated nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Subsequent studies demonstrated that the NFAT complex consists of at least 2 components: a preexisting cytosolic component (NFATP, NFAT1, or NFATC2; 600490) that translocates to the nucleus upon TCR stimulation and an inducible nuclear component. Homodimers or heterodimers of FOS (164810) and JUN (165160) family proteins also combine to form NFAT. Common transcription factors involved in IL2 gene expression include OCT1 (164175), AP1 (165160), and NFKB (164011). For a review, see Horsley and Pavlath (2002). <br>
600490=><br> The NFAT (nuclear factors of activated T cells) transcription complex is a multisubunit transcription factor consisting of at least 3 DNA-binding components, including homodimers or heterodimers of FOS (164810) and JUN (165160) family proteins. NFATC2, also called NFATP, or the 'preexisting component' of NFAT, is present in the cytosolic fraction of unstimulated T cells. After T-cell activation it is found in the nucleus as a part of NFAT. For a review of NFAT proteins, see Horsley and Pavlath (2002). <br>

They share highly conserved regions that are distinct from other bZIP families, such as JUN (165160) and FOS (164810), although remaining regions have diverged considerably from each other (Chan et al., 1995). <br>

600494=><br> POU3F2 belongs to a large family of transcription factors that bind to the octameric DNA sequence ATGCAAAT. Most of these proteins share a highly homologous region, referred to as the POU domain, that occurs in several mammalian transcription factors, including the octamer-binding proteins Oct1 (POU2F1; 164175) and Oct2 (POU2F2; 164176) and the pituitary protein Pit1 (PIT1; 173110). Class III POU genes are expressed predominantly in the central nervous system (CNS). It is likely that CNS-specific transcription factors such as these play an important role in mammalian neurogenesis by regulating their diverse patterns of gene expression (Schreiber et al., 1993; Atanasoski et al., 1995). <br>
600495=><br> All eukaryotic cellular messenger RNAs are posttranscriptionally modified by addition of an m(7)GTP moiety to the 5-prime terminus, referred to as a cap. Recognition of the cap structure and unwinding of mRNA secondary structure during the initiation phase of protein synthesis is catalyzed by initiation factors of the eIF4 group. eIF4E (133440) is a 25-kD cap-binding protein. eIF4A (see 602641) is a 46-kD polypeptide that possesses ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity and RNA-dependent ATPase activity. eIF4B (603928) is a 69-kD RNA-binding protein that enhances the activity of eIF4A. eIF4-gamma, also known as p220, is a 154-kD protein that forms various complexes with the other eIF4 polypeptides. The complex of eIF4A, eIF4E, and eIF4-gamma has been referred to as either eIF4F or eIF4. Collectively, these factors facilitate the recruitment of mRNA to the ribosome, which is the rate-limiting step for protein synthesis under normal conditions. eIF4-gamma is the target for proteolytic cleavage during picornavirus infection, an event that is thought to be responsible for the inhibition of host cellular mRNA translation (Yan and Rhoads, 1995). <br>

In vitro, it phosphorylates and inactivates 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR; 142910) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC; 200350), key enzymes involved in regulating de novo biosynthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids, respectively.

The P2Y1 receptor (P2RY1; 601167) couples to Gq and mobilizes intracellular calcium ions to mediate platelet shape change and aggregation. The second ADP receptor required for aggregation, variously called P2RY12, P2YADP, P2YAC, P2YCYC, or P2TAC, couples to Gi and mediates the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which prevents the accumulation of cAMP. The P2RY12 receptor is the target of efficacious antithrombotic agents, such as ticlopidine and clopidogrel (Hollopeter et al., 2001). <br>

600517=><br> Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) is a member of the ovalbumin family of serine proteinase inhibitors. The protein was isolated from a metastatic cervical squamous cell carcinoma by Kato and Torigoe (1977). SCCA is detected in the superficial and intermediate layers of normal squamous epithelium, whereas the mRNA is detected in the basal and subbasal levels. The clinical import of SCCA has been as a circulating tumor marker for squamous cell carcinoma, especially those of the cervix, head and neck, lung, and esophagus. Many clinical studies of cervical squamous cell carcinoma show that the percentage of patients with elevated circulating levels of SCCA increases from approximately 12% at stage 0 to more than 90% at stage IV. Levels fall after tumor resection and rise in approximately 90% of the patients with recurrent disease. Similar trends occur in the other types of squamous cell carcinoma, with a maximum sensitivity of approximately 60% for lung, 50% for esophageal, and 55% for head and neck tumors. The neutral form of SCCA (SCCA1, or SERPINB3) is detected in the cytoplasm of normal and some malignant squamous cells, whereas the acidic form (SCCA2, or SERPINB4; 600518) is expressed primarily in malignant cells and is the major form found in the plasma of cancer patients. Thus, the appearance of the acidic fraction of SCCA is correlated with more aggressive tumors (summary by Schneider et al., 1995). <br>

600519=><br> Accurate transcription initiation on TATA-containing class II genes involves the ordered assembly of RNA polymerase II (POLR2A; 180660) and the general initiation factors TFIIA, TFIIB (189963), TFIID (313650), TFIIE (189962), TFIIF (189968), TFIIG/TFIIJ, and TFIIH (189972). The first step involves recognition of the TATA element by the TATA-binding subunit (TBP; 600075) and may be regulated by TFIIA, a factor that interacts with both TBP and a TBP-associated factor (TAF; 600475) in TFIID. TFIIA has 2 subunits (43 and 12 kD) in yeast and 3 subunits in higher eukaryotes. In HeLa extracts, it consists of a 35-kD alpha subunit and a 19-kD beta subunit encoded by the N- and C-terminal regions of GTF2A1 (600520), respectively, and a 12-kD gamma subunit encoded by GTF2A2 (DeJong et al., 1995). <br>

600521=><br> The Ra-reactive factor (RARF) is a complement-dependent bactericidal factor that binds to the Ra and R2 polysaccharides expressed by certain enterobacteria. RARF activity is found in the sera of a diverse group of vertebrates, suggesting that it is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to resist infection by these bacterial strains. RARF includes a 100-kD component, CRARF, also called MASP1 or p100, that was thought to activate the complement components C4 (C4F, 120820; C4S, 120810), C2 (613927), and C3 (120700). Subsequent work, however, separated MASP1 from MASP2 (605102) and showed that MASP1 activates C3 and C2, whereas MASP2 activates C4 and C2. The other component of RARF is mannan-binding lectin (154545), a plasma protein member of the complement system that binds to microbial carbohydrates and activates the MASPs. The MASPs then recruit C4 and C2 to generate the C3 convertase or directly activate C3. <br>
600522=><br> Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (PLA2; EC 3.1.1.4) catalyzes the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. Arachidonic acid in turn serves as precursor for a wide spectrum of biologic effectors, collectively known as eicosanoids, that are involved in hemodynamic regulation, inflammatory responses, and other cellular processes. (Eicosanoids are lipid mediators of inflammation; they include a variety of compounds (prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, hydroxy- and epoxy-fatty acids, lipoxins, and isoprostanes) that are derived from the ubiquitous 20-carbon atom arachidonate (20 in Greek is 'eicosa') and a few similar polyunsaturated fatty acids.) <br> Dennis (1994) reviewed various types of PLA2. The best characterized is the group II PLA2 originally isolated from human synovial fluid (i.e., PLA2G2A; 172411). Groups I (human pancreatic, PLA2G1B (172410); also found in cobras and kraits), II (synovial; also found in rattlesnakes and vipers), and III (forms of which were described in bee and lizard) are secreted; group IV is cytosolic. <br>

The CPT I isozymes (CPT1A and CPT1B; 601987) are located in the mitochondrial outer membrane and are detergent-labile, whereas CPT II (600650) is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is detergent-stable (Bieber, 1988; Murthy and Pande, 1987). <br>

600536=><br> Integrins are heterodimeric membrane glycoproteins that mediate a wide spectrum of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. They have preeminent roles in cell migration and morphologic development, differentiation, and metastasis. The diversity and specificity of functions mediated by integrins rest in the structural diversity of the different integrin alpha and beta chains and in their ligand-binding and signal transduction capacities. Alternate splicing increases the structural diversity in the cytoplasmic domains of several integrin alpha and beta chains. The alpha-7 (ITGA7)/beta-1 (ITGB1; 135630) integrin is a specific cellular receptor for the basement membrane protein laminin-1 (see 150320), as well as for laminin-2 (see 156225) and -4.

The latter interacts with a specific cell surface receptor (IL2R) that contains at least 3 subunits: alpha (IL2RA; 147730), beta (IL2RB, or CD122; 146710), and gamma (IL2RG; 308380). A number of other cytokines also stimulate T-cell proliferation, and some of these may use components of the IL2 receptor, including IL15. <br>
600555=><br> The JAK (see JAK1; 147795)/STAT pathway is an extensive signaling pathway downstream of cytokine receptors (see IL2RG; 308380). STATs are cytosolic proteins of 750 to 800 amino acids with a common structure consisting of an N-terminal oligomerization domain, which favors formation of STAT dimers, followed by a DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal SRC (190090) homology-2 (SH2) domain, which is involved in association between STATs and receptors. STAT1 is critical in signal transduction from both the type I interferons IFNA (see 147660) and IFNB (see 147640) and the type II interferon IFNG (147570). After IFNG stimulation, STAT1 is phosphorylated and homodimerizes. This phosphorylated STAT1 homodimer forms the gamma-activating factor (GAF), which translocates to the nucleus and upregulates transcription of IFNG-regulated genes. In contrast, IFNA or IFNB stimulation produces several products, including GAF and a heterotrimer formed by STAT1, STAT2 (600556), and p48 (ISGF3G; 147574) that is called interferon-stimulated gamma factor-3 (ISGF3) (review by Rosenzweig and Holland, 2005). <br>

Mature cadherin proteins are composed of a large N-terminal extracellular domain, a single membrane-spanning domain, and a small C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular domain consists of 5 subdomains, each containing a cadherin motif, and appears to determine the specificity of the homophilic cell adhesion activity of the cadherin; the amino acid sequence of the cytoplasmic domain is highly conserved among cadherins. <br>

600576=><br> The GATA-binding proteins are a group of structurally related transcription factors that control gene expression and differentiation in a variety of cell types. Members of this family of DNA-binding proteins recognize a consensus sequence known as the 'GATA' motif, which is an important cis-element in the promoters of many genes (Arceci et al., 1993). All GATA-binding proteins contain 1 or 2 zinc finger motifs of the distinctive form CXNCX(17)CNXC (Evans et al., 1988). GATA1 (305371), the founding member of the family, is expressed in erythroid cells, megakaryocytes, and other hematopoietic cells. It regulates expression of genes critical for erythroid development, such as the globin genes. GATA2 (137295) is expressed in hematopoietic cells and numerous other cell types. This factor has been implicated in the regulation of endothelial gene expression and hematopoiesis. GATA3 (131320) is expressed in brain and T cells and appears to control expression of T-cell receptor genes. A fourth member of the GATA-binding family, GATA4, is expressed in adult vertebrate heart, gut epithelium, and gonads. During fetal development, GATA4 is expressed in yolk sac endoderm and cells involved in heart formation (Arceci et al., 1993). Promoter and enhancer studies suggested that this factor may regulate genes critical for myocardial differentiation and function, including troponin C (191040), cardiac alpha-myosin heavy chain (MYH6; 160710), and brain-type natriuretic factor (600295) (Durocher et al., 1997). <br>

DNA-binding activity of the bHLH proteins is dependent on formation of homo- and/or heterodimers. Dominant-negative HLH proteins encoded by Id-related genes, such as ID4, also contain the HLH-dimerization domain but lack the DNA-binding basic domain. Consequently, Id proteins inhibit binding to DNA and transcriptional transactivation by heterodimerization with bHLH proteins (Pagliuca et al., 1995). <br>
600582=><br> The ASPH gene encodes 3 proteins, ASPH, junctin, and junctate (or humbug), that differ significantly in their C-terminal domains. Only ASPH contains a C-terminal catalytic domain, which catalyzes the posttranslational hydroxylation of aspartic acid or asparagine residues within epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530)-like domains of numerous proteins (Dinchuk et al., 2002). <br>
600583=><br> Tyrosine kinases can be classified as either membrane associated receptors or intracellular nonreceptor molecules. The latter include BTK (300300), ITK (186973), TXK (600058), and BMX (300101). Mouse Tec is a non-receptor type protein-tyrosine kinase that is highly expressed in many hematopoietic cell lines (Sato et al., 1994). <br>
600584=><br> Homeobox-containing genes play critical roles in regulating tissue-specific gene expression essential for tissue differentiation, as well as determining the temporal and spatial patterns of development (Shiojima et al., 1995). It has been demonstrated that a Drosophila homeobox-containing gene called 'tinman' is expressed in the developing dorsal vessel and in the equivalent of the vertebrate heart. Mutations in tinman result in loss of heart formation in the embryo, suggesting that tinman is essential for Drosophila heart formation. Furthermore, abundant expression of Csx, the presumptive mouse homolog of tinman, is observed only in the heart from the time of cardiac differentiation. CSX, the human homolog of murine Csx, has a homeodomain sequence identical to that of Csx and is expressed only in the heart, again suggesting that CSX plays an important role in human heart formation. <br>

The myogenic basic helix-loop-helix proteins, including myoD (159970), myogenin (159980), MYF5 (159990), and MRF4 (159991) are one class of identified factors. A second family of DNA binding regulatory proteins is the myocyte-specific enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family. Each of these proteins binds to the MEF2 target DNA sequence present in the regulatory regions of many, if not all, muscle-specific genes. The MEF2 genes are members of the MADS gene family (named for the yeast mating type-specific transcription factor MCM1, the plant homeotic genes 'agamous' and 'deficiens' and the human serum response factor SRF (600589)), a family that also includes several homeotic genes and other transcription factors, all of which share a conserved DNA-binding domain. <br>

The NFKB complex is inhibited by I-kappa-B proteins (NFKBIA, 164008, or NFKBIB, 604495), which inactivate NF-kappa-B by trapping it in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of serine residues on the I-kappa-B proteins by kinases (IKBKA or IKBKB, 603258) marks them for destruction via the ubiquitination pathway, thereby allowing activation of the NF-kappa-B complex. Activated NFKB complex translocates into the nucleus and binds DNA at kappa-B-binding motifs such as 5-prime GGGRNNYYCC 3-prime or 5-prime HGGARNYYCC 3-prime (where H is A, C, or T; R is an A or G purine; and Y is a C or T pyrimidine). <br>
600665=><br> Melatonin, the principal hormone of the pineal gland, functions through pharmacologically specific, G protein-coupled receptors. Melatonin can alter the timing of mammalian circadian rhythms, as well as regulate the reproductive alterations that occur in response to changes in day length in seasonally breeding mammals. The circadian effects of melatonin appear to be mediated by melatonin receptors in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus, the site of a circadian clock. The reproductive effects of melatonin may be mediated by receptors in the hypophyseal pars tuberalis. MTNR1A is a high-affinity melatonin receptor that likely mediates these 2 major biologic functions of melatonin in mammals (Slaugenhaupt et al., 1995). <br>

600674=><br> Microtia-anotia (M-A) can occur either as an isolated defect or in association with other defects. Only in a minority of cases has a genetic or environmental cause been found; in these cases, M-A is usually part of a specific pattern of multiple congenital anomalies. For instance, M-A is an essential component of isotretinoin embryopathy (243440), is an important manifestation of thalidomide embryopathy, and can be part of the prenatal alcohol syndrome and maternal diabetes embryopathy. M-A occurs with a number of single gene disorders, such as Treacher Collins syndrome (154500), branchiotorenal/branchiootic syndromes (see 113650 and 602588), oculoauricular syndrome (612109), microtia with hearing impairment and cleft palate (612290), or chromosomal syndromes, such as trisomy 18. M-A also occurs as part of seemingly nonrandom patterns of multiple defects, such as Goldenhar syndrome (164210) (Mastroiacovo et al., 1995). <br> Alasti and Van Camp (2009) reviewed the genetics of microtia and microtia-associated syndromes and discussed their clinical aspects in relation to the causative genes.

BMPs act on osteoblasts and chondrocytes as well as other cell types, including neurocells, and they play important roles in embryonal development. Members of the BMP family include BMP1 (112264) to BMP6 (112266), BMP7 (112267), also called osteogenic protein-1 (OP1), OP2 (BMP8; 602284), and others. BMPs belong to the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, which includes, in addition to the TGF-betas (e.g., 190180), activin/inhibins (e.g., alpha-inhibin; 147380), mullerian inhibiting substance (600957), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (600837). TGF-betas and activins transduce their signals through the formation of heteromeric complexes of 2 different types of serine (threonine) kinase receptors: type I receptors of about 50 to 55 kD and type II receptors of about 70 to 80 kD. Type II receptors bind ligands in the absence of type I receptors, but they require their respective type I receptors for signaling, whereas type I receptors require their respective type II receptors for ligand binding.

GBD prevalence is particularly high in some minority populations in the United States, including native and Mexican Americans. Gallstones composed of cholesterol (cholelithiasis) are the common manifestations of GBD in western countries, including the United States. Most people with gallstones, however, remain asymptomatic through their lifetimes; it is estimated that approximately 10 to 50% of individuals eventually develop symptoms. The significant risk factors associated with GBD are age, female sex, obesity (especially central obesity), lipids, diet, parity, type 2 diabetes (125853), medications, and Mexican American ethnicity. GBD appears to be strongly related to the metabolic syndrome (605552) and/or its major components, such as hyperinsulinism, dyslipidemia, and abdominal adiposity (Boland et al., 2002; Tsai et al., 2004).

In mammalian tissues, several groups of PLCs have been characterized, including PLC-beta, and each group contains at least 3 isoforms.

600812=><br> Alternative mRNA splicing plays an important role in development and differentiation; many transcripts are spliced differently in distinct cell types and tissues. Both constitutive and alternative splicing occurs on spliceosomes, which are complex particles composed of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and non-snRNP proteins. The SR family of non-snRNP splicing factors is characterized by the presence of an RNA recognition motif and a serine- and arginine-rich (SR) domain. SR proteins are required at early stages of spliceosome assembly, have distinct but overlapping specificities for different pre-mRNAs, and can alter splice site choice, suggesting that they may be involved in the regulation of alternative splicing in vivo. Two of the SR proteins, ASF/SF2 (SFRS1) and SC35 (SFRS2; 600813), have been extensively characterized (Bermingham et al., 1995). <br>

600917=><br> The glycogen-associated form of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) derived from skeletal muscle is a heterodimer composed of a 37-kD catalytic subunit (176875) and a 124-kD targeting and regulatory subunit, referred to as PP1G by Hansen et al.

PP1G binds to muscle glycogen with high affinity, thereby enhancing dephosphorylation of glycogen-bound substrates for PP1 such as glycogen synthase (e.g., 138570) and glycogen phosphorylase kinase (e.g., 311870). Phosphorylation at ser46 of the PP1G subunit in response to insulin increases PP1 activity, while phosphorylation at ser65 in response to adrenaline causes dissociation of the catalytic subunit from the G subunit and inhibits glycogen synthesis. Because of these functions, PP1G was postulated to be involved in noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM; 125853) and obesity. <br>

The archetypal KATP channel is an octameric complex of KCNJ11 subunits and either SUR1 (ABCC8; 600509) subunits in pancreatic beta cells and many neurons or SUR2 (ABCC9; 601439) subunits in muscle. Four KCNJ11 subunits form the channel pore, and each is associated with a SUR subunit that contributes to regulation of channel gating (summary by Girard et al., 2009). <br>

Colligins are characterized by an amino acid structure that includes an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence and 2 putative N-linked oligosaccharide attachment sites (Clarke et al., 1991). Colligins also have a C-terminal RDEL sequence that acts as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention sequence. Other features permit the colligin-binding protein of ER to be classified as a serpin (serine-arginine protease inhibitor). <br>
600944=><br> Joe et al. (1995) stated that the unusual amino acid hypusine is formed posttranslationally and is only found in a single cellular protein, eukaryotic translation initiation factor-5A (EIF5A; see 600187). Hypusine biosynthesis involves 2 enzymatic steps. In the first step, deoxyhypusine synthase (EC 2.5.1.46) catalyzes the NAD-dependent transfer of the butylamine moiety of spermidine to the epsilon-amino group of a specific lysine residue of the EIF5A precursor protein to form the intermediate deoxyhypusine residue. In the second step, mediated by deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (611262), the conversion of the deoxyhypusine residue to the hypusine residue completes EIF5A maturation. Hypusine is found in all eukaryotes and in some archaebacteria, but not in eubacteria. The amino acid sequence of EIF5A is highly conserved, especially in the region surrounding the hypusine residue, suggesting an important fundamental function for this protein throughout eukaryotic evolution. Hypusine and EIF5A appear to be vital for cell proliferation in eukaryotes. <br>

Voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels not only mediate the entry of Ca(2+) ions into excitable cells but are also involved in a variety of Ca(2+)-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. Diriong et al. (1995) noted that calcium channels are multisubunit complexes and that the channel activity is directed by a pore-forming alpha-1 subunit, which is often sufficient to generate voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channel activity. There are at least 6 classes of alpha-1 subunits: alpha-1A, B, C, D, E, and S, which are derived from 6 genes representing members of a gene family. The auxiliary subunits beta (e.g., 114207), alpha-2/delta, and gamma (e.g., 114209) regulate channel activity. <br>

Interest in syntrophin came first from its location at the neuromuscular junction and later from the demonstration that it is directly associated with dystrophin (310200). A potential role for the dystrophin-associated proteins in agrin-stimulated nicotinic acetylcholine receptor clustering has implicated syntrophin in the process of synaptogenesis. At least 3 different but highly conserved syntrophin isoforms are encoded by distinct genes: alpha-1, beta-1 (600026), and beta-2 (600027). Each has approximately 50% amino acid identity with the other 2. These 3 syntrophins can be separated into 2 classes based on isoelectric points: the acidic isoform, alpha-1-syntrophin (pI = 6.7), and the 2 basic forms, beta-1 and beta-2 (pI = 9.0). <br>

The NFKB complex is inhibited by I-kappa-B proteins (NFKBIA, 164008 or NFKBIB, 604495), which inactivate NF-kappa-B by trapping it in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of serine residues on the I-kappa-B proteins by kinases (IKBKA, 600664 or IKBKB, 603258) marks them for destruction via the ubiquitination pathway, thereby allowing activation of the NF-kappa-B complex. Activated NFKB complex translocates into the nucleus and binds DNA at kappa-B-binding motifs such as 5-prime GGGRNNYYCC 3-prime or 5-prime HGGARNYYCC 3-prime (where H is A, C, or T; R is an A or G purine; and Y is a C or T pyrimidine). <br>

Glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved in most aspects of normal brain function and can be perturbed in many neuropathologic conditions. Imbalances in glutamatergic function have been implicated in neuronal death following ischemia, in hypoglycemia or anoxia, in epilepsy, and in neurodegenerative disorders. Glutamate actions are mediated by glutamate receptors which fall into 2 distinct classes: ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are ligand-gated ion channels whose responses to selective agonists define the N-methyl-D-aspartate (e.g., 138249), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxasole-4-propionate (e.g., 138248), and kainate (e.g., 138245) subtypes. The metabotropic glutamate receptors, which are coupled through GTP-binding proteins to second-messenger pathways, can be involved in the stimulation of phospholipase C, the presynaptic inhibition of glutamate release, the closure of cation channels in retinal ON bipolar cells, and the modulation of adenylate cyclase. The 8 distinct metabotropic glutamate receptors that have been identified can be classified into 3 groups according to their sequence similarities, pharmacologic properties, and preferred signal transduction mechanism (Kuramoto et al., 1994). <br>

Members of the family include epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin; 192090), neural cadherin (N-cadherin; 114020), placental cadherin (P-cadherin; 114021), muscle cadherin (M-cadherin; 114019), and vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin, or CDH5). They share a common domain structure and primary sequence homologies. Each cadherin type has a unique tissue-distribution pattern. In most of them, expression is not restricted to 1 cell type, and more than 1 cadherin type may be found at the surface of a particular cell. The authors stated that endothelial cells have been shown to express N-cadherin, VE-cadherin, and to a lesser extent, P-cadherin.

601122=><br> Multiple receptor subtypes of serotonin neurotransmitters with multiple physiologic functions have been recognized. The 5-HT-2 receptors mediate many of the central and peripheral physiologic functions of serotonin. Cardiovascular effects include contraction of blood vessels and shape changes in platelets; central nervous system effects include neuronal sensitization to tactile stimuli and mediation of hallucinogenic effects of phenylisopropylamine hallucinogens. <br>

The GD3 ganglioside is the first ganglioside in the b-series synthetic pathway and is highly expressed in the early stage of development in fetal rat brain and in human melanoma tissues and melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, the GD3 ganglioside has been shown to be important for cell adhesion and growth of cultured malignant cells. ST8SIA1, or GD3 synthase, catalyzes the formation of GD3 ganglioside by transfer of a sialic acid molecule from CMP-NeuAc to the terminal sialic acid of GM3 via an alpha 2-8 linkage (Sasaki et al., 1994). <br>
601124=><br> The semaphorins are a family of proteins that are involved in signaling. All the family members have a secretion signal, a 500-amino acid sema domain, and 16 conserved cysteine residues (Kolodkin et al., 1993). Sequence comparisons have grouped the secreted semaphorins into 3 general classes, all of which also have an immunoglobulin domain. The semaphorin III family, consisting of human semaphorin III (SEMA3A; 603961), chicken collapsin, and mouse semaphorins A, D, and E, all have a basic domain at the C terminus. Chicken collapsin contributes to path finding by axons during development by inhibiting extension of growth cones (Luo et al., 1993) through an interaction with a collapsin response mediator protein of relative molecular mass 62K (CRMP62) (Goshima et al., 1995), a putative homolog of an axonal guidance associated UNC33 gene product (601168). SEMA3F is a secreted member of the semaphorin III family. <br>

Five classes of histone genes have been reported (see 142711). Some classes are expressed only during S phase, while others are replication independent. The latter are referred to as replacement histones and are expressed in quiescent or terminally differentiated cells. H3.3 is a replacement histone that is encoded by 2 distinct replication-independent genes, H3.3A (H3F3A; 601128) and H3.3B (H3F3B). The proteins encoded by the H3.3A and H3.3B genes are identical (summary by Wells et al. (1987) and Albig et al. (1995)). <br>

The beta subunits (see also KCNAB2 601142 and KCNB3 604111) modulate the gating properties and amplitudes of the alpha-subunit potassium channels, such as KCNA1 (176260). 'Shaker' and other voltage-dependent potassium channel proteins help to determine the electrical properties of excitable cells and play additional physiologic roles in nonexcitable cell types. Voltage-activated, outwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kv) are heterooligomers that are assembled from alpha and beta subunits in a 1:1 molar ratio (summary by Schultz et al., 1996). <br>
601142=><br> 'Shaker' and other voltage-dependent potassium channel proteins help to determine the electrical properties of excitable cells and play additional physiologic roles in nonexcitable cell types. See KCNA1 (176260). Mammalian Shaker potassium channel alpha subunits associate with cytoplasmic beta subunits that modulate the inactivation of the channel. The beta subunits belong to a superfamily of NAD(P)H-dependent enzymes, suggesting that they may be involved in additional physiologic processes. Shaker potassium channel complexes are thought to be composed of 4 alpha and 4 beta subunits. <br>
601143=><br> Cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule-based biologic motor protein. Holzbaur and Tokito (1996) noted that dyneins were initially discovered as enzymes that couple ATP hydrolysis to provide a force for cellular motility in eukaryotic cilia and flagella. A distinct cytoplasmic form of dynein (600112) was subsequently characterized and thought to be responsible for the intracellular retrograde motility of vesicles and organelles along microtubules (Holzbaur and Vallee, 1994). A large macromolecular complex, dynactin, is required for the cytoplasmic dynein-driven movement of organelles along microtubules. Dynactin is composed of 10 distinct polypeptides of 150, 135, 62, 50 (DCTN2; 607376), 45, 42, 37, 32, 27, and 24 kD, with a combined mass of 10 million daltons. The largest polypeptide of the dynactin complex, p150(Glued), binds directly to microtubules and to cytoplasmic dynein. The binding of dynactin to dynein is critical for neuronal function, as antibodies that specifically disrupt this binding block vesicle motility along microtubules in extruded squid axoplasm. Holzbaur and Tokito (1996) stated that the dynein-dynactin interaction is probably a key component of the mechanism of axonal transport of vesicles and organelles. Further evidence for a critical role for dynactin in vivo comes from the analysis of mutations in the homologous gene in Drosophila. Mutant alleles of the 'glued' gene induced disruption of the neurons of the optic lobe and compound eye in heterozygotes; null mutations are lethal. <br>

Formerly termed Bantu siderosis, the disorder results from a predisposition to iron loading that is exacerbated by excessive intake of dietary iron. It is particularly a problem among Africans who drink a traditional beer brewed in non-galvanized steel drums. Although the disorder was once attributed to dietary excess alone, serious iron overload does not develop in all beer drinkers, and not all patients with iron overload consume excessive amounts of the beer (summary by Andrews, 1999). <br>

601200=><br> Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is a rare pediatric tumor of the lung that arises during fetal lung development and is often part of an inherited cancer syndrome (Hill et al., 2009). PPBs contain both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Early in tumorigenesis, cysts form in lung airspaces, and these cysts are lined with benign-appearing epithelium. Mesenchymal cells susceptible to malignant transformation reside within the cyst walls and form a dense 'cambium' layer beneath the epithelial lining. In a subset of patients, overgrowth of the mesenchymal cells produces a sarcoma, a transition that is associated with a poorer prognosis (Priest et al., 1996). <br> In approximately 35% of families in which a child has PPB, the patient or a family member manifests 1 or more additional conditions from an unusual array of dysontogenetic-dysplastic and malignant conditions, known as the 'PPB family tumor and dysplasia syndrome' (PPBFTDS). Cystic nephroma, which are benign lesions of the kidney, are found in 9 to 10% of family members affected by PPB (summary by Bahubeshi et al,. 2010). <br>

For example, members of the neural-specific TRK (NTRK1; 191315) family that recognize nerve growth factor are absolutely required for the survival and development of discrete neuronal subpopulations, and the receptor tyrosine kinases TIE1 (600222) and TIE2 (600221) play a critical role in the development of normal blood vessels. <br>

601329=><br> There are numerous eukaryotic LIM proteins, so named for the LIM domains they contain. LIM domains are highly conserved cysteine-rich structures containing 2 zinc fingers (Mizuno et al., 1994). Although zinc fingers usually function by binding to DNA or RNA, the LIM motif probably mediates protein-protein interactions. LIM kinase-1 (LIMK1) belongs to a small subfamily with a unique combination of 2 N-terminal LIM motifs and a C-terminal protein kinase domain. These are linked by a proline-serine-rich region containing several putative casein kinase and map kinase recognition sites (Mizuno et al., 1994). LIMK1 lacks a signal peptide and putative transmembrane domains. Thus, it is likely to be a component of an intracellular signaling pathway and may be involved in brain development (Tassabehji et al., 1996). <br>

JUN N-terminal kinases (JNKs; see 601158) are MAPKs that stimulate transcriptional activity of JUN (165160) in response to growth factors, proinflammatory cytokines, and certain environmental stresses, such as ultraviolet light or osmotic shock. MAP2K4 is a MAPKK that directly activates the JNKs, as well as the related MAPK p38 (MAPK14; 600289) (Wu et al., 1997). <br>

The resulting Glc(2)-Man(9)-GlcNAc(2) intermediate is then further modified by glucosidase II and several ER- and Golgi-resident mannosidases and glycosyltransferases, finally yielding a complex array of glycan structures. <br>

601397=><br> T protein is vital for the formation and differentiation of posterior mesoderm and for axial development in all vertebrates. Edwards et al.

In zebrafish the 'no tail' mutation (ntl) is the homolog of 'Brachyury.' Ntl embryos die after hatching, lack notochords and tails, and possess abnormal trunk somites. The T gene encodes a transcription factor that binds to a specific DNA element via its N-terminal region. A protein motif within the DNA-binding domain, the so-called T box, is highly conserved among T homologs from different species and also defines a broader family of T-box genes; see TBX2 (600747). <br>

601410=><br> Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM), defined as insulin-requiring hyperglycemia within the first month of life, is a rare entity, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 400,000 neonates (Shield, 2000). In about half of the neonates, diabetes is transient and resolves at a median age of 3 months, whereas the rest have a permanent form of diabetes (606176). In a significant number of patients with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus, type II diabetes appears later in life (Arthur et al., 1997). <br> The major cause of transient neonatal diabetes (TND) is aberrant expression of imprinted genes at chromosome 6q24, associated in 20% of cases with DNA hypomethylation at the TND differentially methylated region (DMR), which lies within the imprinted promoter of the PLAGL1 gene (603044; Mackay et al., 2005). Over 50% of individuals with TND and hypomethylation at 6q24 also show mosaic DNA hypomethylation at other imprinted loci throughout the genome and a range of additional clinical features. Mackay et al. (2008) found that mutations in the ZFP57 gene are associated with TND with hypomethylation of the TND DMR as well as hypomethylation of the PEG3 (601483) and GRB10 (601523) DMRs, and heterogeneous clinical features. <br>

601415=><br> The MYBL2 gene belongs to the MYB family of transcription factor genes and plays an essential role during cell cycle progression. MYBL2 transcripts are detectable in a wide variety of dividing cell types. MYBL2 activates CDC2 (116940) and cyclin D1 (168461) gene expression in proliferating fibroblasts, and antisense oligonucleotides specific to MYBL2 inhibit proliferation of human hematopoietic cell lines. MYBL2 expression is also regulated at the G1/S phase transition, and its transcription relies on E2F (189971) activity in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Thus, unlike MYB (189990) and MYBL1 (159405), whose transcriptional activity is mainly restricted to hematopoietic, spermatogenic, and neural progenitor cells, MYBL2 appears to possess a broader function during cell proliferation (Noben-Trauth et al., 1996). <br>

It is involved in protein, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, as well as in the control of gene transcription, growth, development, and differentiation.

The morphologic changes in skeletal muscle in MFM result from disintegration of the sarcomeric Z disc and the myofibrils, followed by abnormal ectopic accumulation of multiple proteins involved in the structure of the Z disc, including desmin, alpha-B-crystallin (CRYAB; 123590), dystrophin (300377), and myotilin (TTID; 604103). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Myofibrillar Myopathy <br> Other forms of MFM include alpha-B crystallinopathy (608810), caused by mutation in the CRYAB gene; myotilinopathy (609200) and spheroid body myopathy (182920), both caused by mutation in the myotilin gene; ZASP-related MFM (609452), caused by mutation in the ZASP gene (LDB3; 605906); FLNC-related MFM (609524), caused by mutation in the FLNC gene (102565); and BAG3-related MFM (612954), caused by mutation in the BAG3 gene (603883). <br> 'Desmin-related myopathy' is another term referring to MFM in which there are intrasarcoplasmic aggregates of desmin, usually in addition to other sarcomeric proteins. Rigid spine syndrome (602771), caused by mutation in the SEPN1 gene (606210), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia-7 (ARVD7; 609160), which maps to chromosome 10q22.3, are other desmin-related myopathies.

Patients with SCID present in infancy with recurrent, persistent infections by opportunistic organisms, including Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii, and cytomegalovirus, among many others. Laboratory analysis shows profound lymphopenia with diminished or absent immunoglobulins. The common characteristic of all types of SCID is absence of T cell-mediated cellular immunity due to a defect in T-cell development. Without treatment, patients usually die within the first year of life. The overall prevalence of all types of SCID is approximately 1 in 75,000 births (Fischer et al., 1997; Buckley, 2004). <br> SCID can be divided into 2 main classes: those with B lymphocytes (B+ SCID) and those without (B- SCID). Presence or absence of NK cells is variable within these groups. The most common form of SCID is X-linked T-, B+, NK- SCID (300400) caused by mutation in the IL2RG gene (308380) on chromosome Xq13.1. Autosomal recessive SCID includes T-, B+, NK- SCID (600802) caused by mutation in the JAK3 gene (600173) on 19p13.1; T-, B+, NK+ SCID (608971) caused by mutation in the IL7R gene (146661) on 5p13, the CD45 gene (151460) on 1q31-q32, or the CD3D gene (186790) on 11q23; T-, B-, NK- SCID (102700) caused by mutation in the ADA (608958) gene on 20q13.11; T-, B-, NK+ SCID with sensitivity to ionizing radiation caused by mutation in the Artemis gene on 10p; and T-, B-, NK+ SCID caused by mutation in the RAG1 and RAG2 genes on 11p13 (Kalman et al., 2004). <br> Approximately 20 to 30% of all SCID patients are T-, B-, NK+, and approximately half of these patients have mutations in the RAG1 or RAG2 genes (Schwarz et al., 1996; Fischer et al., 1997). <br>

Chemokine receptors, such as CX3CR1, belong to the 7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family and are grouped into 4 subfamilies based on the subfamily of their chemokine ligand. CX3CR1 is the receptor for fractalkine (CX3CL1; 601880) and is mainly expressed by CD16 (FCGR3A; 146740)-high natural killer (NK) cells, terminally differentiated cytotoxic CD8 (see 186910)-positive T cells, and monocytes (summary by Nakayama et al., 2010). <br>

Phylogenetic analysis of the myosin motor domains identified 11 distinct classes, 7 of which are expressed in vertebrates. These 7 vertebrate myosin classes include conventional myosin (myosin II) and 6 less well characterized unconventional myosin classes, myosins I, V (see 160777), VI (600970), VII (see 276903), IX, and X (601481). Each myosin has a conserved N-terminal motor domain (25 to 40% identical at the amino acid level) that contains both ATP-binding and actin-binding sequences. Following the motor domain is a light-chain-binding 'neck' region containing 1-6 copies of a repeat element, the IQ motif, that serves as a binding site for calmodulin (114180) or other members of the EF-hand superfamily of calcium-binding proteins. At the C terminus, each myosin class has a distinct tail domain that serves in dimerization, membrane binding, protein binding, and/or enzymatic activities and targets each myosin to its particular subcellular location (review by Mooseker and Cheney, 1995 and Hasson et al., 1996). <br>

601487=><br> Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), such as PPARG, are so named because they bind chemicals that induce proliferation of peroxisomes, organelles that contribute to the oxidation of fatty acids. As members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, PPARs act by controlling networks of target genes. PPARs can be activated by both dietary fatty acids and their metabolic derivatives in the body, and thus serve as lipid sensors that, when activated, can markedly redirect metabolism. PPARA (170998) and PPARG are predominantly expressed in liver and adipose tissue, respectively. PPARD (600409) is abundantly expressed throughout the body, but at only low levels in liver. Consistent with their expression profiles, the PPARs each have unique functions in the regulation of energy metabolism. PPARG is involved in adipocyte differentiation (summary by Evans et al., 2004). <br>

601495=><br> Agammaglobulinemia is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by profoundly low or absent serum antibodies and low or absent circulating B cells due to an early block of B-cell development. Affected individuals develop severe infections in the first years of life. The most common form of agammaglobulinemia is X-linked agammaglobulinemia (AGMX1, XLA; 300755), also known as Bruton disease, which is caused by mutation in the BTK gene (300300). AGMX1 accounts for anywhere from 85 to 95% of males who have the characteristic findings (Lopez Granados et al., 2002; Ferrari et al., 2007). Autosomal recessive inheritance of agammaglobulinemia, which has a similar phenotype to that of the X-linked form, has been observed in a small number of families, and accounts for up to 15% of patients with agammaglobulinemia (Ferrari et al., 2007). Conley (1999) gave a comprehensive review of autosomal recessive agammaglobulinemia. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Autosomal Agammaglobulinemia <br> Autosomal agammaglobulinemia is a genetically heterogeneous disorder: see also AGM2 (613500), caused by mutation in the IGLL1 gene (146770); AGM3 (613501), caused by mutation in the CD79A gene (112205); AGM4 (613502), caused by mutation in the BLNK gene (604515); AGM5 (613506), caused by disruption of the LRRC8 gene (608360); and AGM6 (612692), caused by mutation in the CD79B gene (147245). <br>

601627=><br> The SMN1 (600354) and SMN2 genes lie within the telomeric and centromeric halves, respectively, of a large, inverted duplication on chromosome 5q13. These genes share more than 99% nucleotide identity, and both are capable of encoding a 294-amino acid RNA-binding protein, SMN, that is required for efficient assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes. Homozygous loss of the SMN1 gene causes spinal muscular atrophy (SMA; 253300). Absence of SMN1 is partially compensated for by SMN2, which produces enough SMN protein to allow for relatively normal development in cell types other than motor neurons. However, SMN2 cannot fully compensate for loss of SMN1 because, although SMN2 is transcribed at a level comparable to that of SMN1, a large majority of SMN2 transcripts lack exon 7, resulting in production of a truncated, less stable SMN protein (Lefebvre et al., 1995; Kashima et al., 2007). <br>

Based on their position within this proteolytic cascade, caspases are subdivided into initiator caspases, which include caspase-8 (601763) and caspase-9 (602234), and executioner caspases, which include caspase-3 (600636, also called CPP32), caspase-6 (601532, also called MCH2), and caspase-7, as well as a third group of caspases involved in cytokine activation, namely, caspase-1 (147678, also called ICE), caspase-4 (602664), and caspase-5 (602665).

Changes in the external environment, particularly in the light-dark cycle, entrain this biologic clock. Under constant environmental conditions devoid of time cues, rhythms driven by the biologic clock show a period near, but usually not equal to, 24 hours. The bilaterally paired suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus are thought to contain the master circadian clock that regulates most, if not all, circadian rhythms in mammals.

601928=><br> In addition to the epithelial, or soft, alpha-keratins, the keratin multigene family comprises the smaller family of hard alpha-keratins that, in accordance with their most frequently investigated site of expression, are referred to as hair keratins. Independent of species, the hair keratin family consists of several members of each of 2 subfamilies; according to Winter et al. (1997), 7 type I human hair keratins (e.g., KRTHA1; 601077) and 4 type II hair keratins had been identified. <br> Rogers et al. (1997) reviewed human hair keratin nomenclature. Expression studies showed that hair keratin synthesis is not restricted to the hair follicle and the cortex but clearly begins earlier in matrix cells of the hair bulb. Whereas both matrix and cuticle trichocytes appear to express only 1 keratin pair each, keratin expression in the cortex involves at least 4 sequentially synthesized, structurally highly related keratin pairs. The keratins have highly homologous central alpha-helical rod domains flanked by variable-sized head and tail domains. The boundary peptides at the extremities of the rod domain (the helix initiation motif (HIM) of the 1A subdomain and the helix termination motif (HTM) of the 2B subdomain) are highly conserved and crucial for structure and function. Pathogenic mutations, which have been described in epithelial alpha-keratins in a number of hereditary disorders of skin, skin appendages, and oral mucosa, appear most disruptive when located in the HIMs or HTMs of keratins. See KRTHA1 for additional general information on hair keratins. <br>

DNAJ proteins may have up to 3 distinct domains: a conserved 70-amino acid J domain, usually at the N terminus; a glycine/phenylalanine (G/F)-rich region; and a cysteine-rich domain containing 4 motifs resembling a zinc finger domain (Ohtsuka and Hata, 2000). <br>
601965=><br> The lysosphingolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, motility, and neurite retraction. Its actions may be both intracellular as a second messenger and extracellular as a receptor ligand. S1P and the structurally related lysolipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signal cells through a set of G protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) known as EDG receptors. Some EDG receptors (e.g., EDG1; 601974) are S1P receptors; others (e.g., EDG2; 602282) are LPA receptors. <br> Chun et al. (2002) proposed a nomenclature scheme for the lysophosphatic acid (LPA) and sphingosine 1-phosphatase (S1P) receptors that is consistent with the International Union of Pharmacology (IUP) guidelines. According to these guidelines, a receptor is to be named with the abbreviation of the natural agonist with the highest potency, followed by a subscripted arabic number.

601972=><br> ROR-beta is a transcription factor and belongs to the nuclear receptor family (Carlberg et al., 1994). Members of this superfamily share a common modular structure composed of a transactivation domain, a DNA-binding domain, and a ligand-binding domain (Evans, 1988). Typically, their transcriptional transactivation function is regulated by small lipophilic molecules, such as steroid hormones, vitamin D, retinoic acids, and thyroid hormone. These molecules are synthesized in the organism and pass readily through the plasma membrane to reach the corresponding receptors inside the cell. In addition to the classic hormone receptors, a growing number of nuclear receptors for which no ligands are known have been identified by homology cloning. These nuclear receptors are referred to as 'orphan' nuclear receptors. ROR-beta is such an orphan nuclear receptor, forming a subfamily with the closely related nuclear receptors ROR-alpha (RORA; 600825) and ROR-gamma (RORC; 602943). <br>

Onset is usually in the first or second decade, before the end of puberty (reviewed by Delatycki et al., 2000). <br> For a general phenotypic description of Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), see FRDA1 (229300), which is caused by mutation in the FXN gene (606829) on chromosome 9q13. <br>
601993=><br> The NCOA2 gene encodes nuclear receptor coactivator 2, which aids in the function of nuclear hormone receptors. Nuclear hormone receptors are conditional transcription factors that play important roles in various aspects of cell growth, development, and homeostasis by controlling expression of specific genes. Members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, which includes the 5 steroid receptors and class II nuclear receptors (see below), are structurally characterized by 3 distinct domains: an N-terminal transcriptional activation domain, a central DNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal hormone-binding domain. Before the binding of hormone, steroid receptors, which are sometimes called class I of the nuclear hormone receptor family, remain inactive in a complex with heat-shock protein-90 (140571) and other stress family proteins. Binding of hormone induces critical conformational changes in steroid receptors that cause them to dissociate from the inhibitory complex, bind as homodimers to specific DNA enhancer elements associated with target genes, and modulate that gene's transcription. After binding to enhancer elements, transcription factors require transcriptional coactivator proteins to mediate their stimulation of transcription initiation (Hong et al., 1997). <br>

Hypocalcemia is a secondary consequence of parathyroid failure and parathyroid hormone resistance as a result of severe magnesium deficiency. The disease typically manifests during the first months of life with generalized convulsions or signs of increased neuromuscular excitabiity, such as muscle spasms or tetany. Untreated, the disease may be fatal or lead to severe neurologic damage. Treatment includes immediate administration of magnesium, usually intravenously, followed by life-long high-dose oral magnesium (reviewed by Knoers, 2009). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Hypomagnesemia <br> A form of hypomagnesemia due to kidney defects and high urinary magnesium excretion associated with hypocalciuria (HOMG2; 154020) is caused by mutation in the FXYD2 gene (601814). Renal hypomagnesemia-3 (HOMG3; 248250), associated with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis, is caused by mutation in the CLDN16 gene (603959). Renal hypomagnesemia-4 (HOMG4; 611718), which is normocalciuric, is caused by mutation in the EGF gene (131530). Renal hypomagnesemia-5 (HOMG5; 248190), associated with hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and severe ocular involvement, is caused by mutation in the CLDN19 gene (610036).

Other members of this family include DRADA (ADAR; 146920) and RED1 (ADARB1; 601218) (Mittaz et al., 1997). <br>
602066=><br> Benign familial infantile convulsions (BFIC; see 601764) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by afebrile seizures occurring between 3 and 12 months of age. Paroxysmal choreoathetosis is a disorder of involuntary movements characterized by attacks that occur spontaneously or are induced by a variety of stimuli. <br> The ICCA syndrome shares overlapping clinical features with benign familial infantile convulsions and paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis (PKC; 128200); BFIC2 (605751), PKC, and ICCA map to the same region on chromosome 16, suggesting that they may be allelic disorders.

602081=><br> Speech-language disorder-1 is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by severe orofacial dyspraxia resulting in largely incomprehensible speech. Affected individuals were originally thought to have specific defects in the use of grammatical suffixation rules (Gopnik, 1990; Gopnik and Crago, 1991). The phenotype, however, is broader in nature, with virtually every aspect of grammar and language affected (Fisher et al., 1998). Vargha-Khadem et al. (1998) concluded that the disorder is characterized by abnormal development of several brain areas critical for both orofacial movements and sequential articulation, resulting in marked disruption of speech and expressive language. <br> - Relation to Specific Language Impairment <br> Children who fail to develop expressive and/or receptive language normally, in the absence of explanatory factors such as neurologic disorders, hearing impairment, or lack of adequate opportunity, are clinically described as having specific language impairment (SLI) (Bartlett et al., 2002). SLI has a prevalence of approximately 2% (Fisher et al., 1998) to 7% (Bartlett et al., 2002) in children entering school and is associated with later difficulties in learning to read. SLI aggregates in families, and increased monozygotic versus dizygotic twin concordance rates indicate that heredity, not just shared environment, is the cause of familial clustering (summary by Bartlett et al., 2002). The majority of families segregating such disorders show complex patterns of inheritance (Fisher et al., 1998). <br> Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involved in specific language impairment (SLI), a phenotype that shows some overlap with SPCH1, have been mapped to chromosomes 16q (SLI1; 606711), 19q (SLI2; 606712), 13q21 (SLI3; 607134), and 7q35-q36 (SLI4; 612514). <br> See also familial developmental dysphasia (600117). <br>

602089=><br> Capillary hemangiomas are benign, highly proliferative lesions involving aberrant localized growth of capillary endothelium. They are the most common tumor of infancy, occurring in up to 10% of all births (Mulliken and Young, 1988). Hemangiomas tend to appear shortly after birth and show rapid neonatal growth for up to 12 months characterized by endothelial hypercellularity and increased numbers of mast cells. This phase is followed by slow involution at a rate of about 10% per year and replacement by fibrofatty stroma. Hemangiomas are classified as distinct from vascular malformations (see, e.g., CMC1, 163000; 108010; and CCM, 116860), in that the latter are present from birth, tend to grow with the individual, do not regress, and show normal rates of endothelial cell turnover (Spring and Bentz, 2005; Legiehn and Heran, 2006). Legiehn and Heran (2006) noted that the term 'hemangioma' in adults is considered inaccurate and should be discarded. <br> Most hemangiomas occur sporadically, but some families with autosomal dominant inheritance have been reported (Walter et al., 1999). <br>

TGF-beta molecules are secreted in the form of latent large molecular mass complexes that contain other proteins, such as latent TGF-beta-1 binding protein (LTBP1; 150390). There is evidence that these binding proteins modulate TGF-beta bioavailability. <br> See Oklu and Hesketh (2000) for a review of the LTBP gene family. <br>

The complex consists of a 7S (or 7SL) RNA and 6 different proteins, SRP9 (600707), SRP14 (600708), SRP19 (182175), SRP54 (604857), SRP68 (604858), and SRP72. The proteins are bound to the 7S RNA as monomers (SRP19 and SRP54) or heterodimers (SRP9/SRP14 and SRP68/SRP72). SRP9 and SRP14 constitute the Alu domain of 7S, whereas the other 4 proteins belong to the S domain.

602148=><br> The SRY (480000) and SOX proteins share a DNA-binding domain known as the HMG box, defined by a 79-amino acid region. All SOX proteins have a single HMG box and bind linear DNA in a sequence-specific manner, resulting in the bending of DNA through large angles. Bending causes the DNA helix to open for some distance, which may affect binding and interactions of other transcription factors. SOX1, SOX2 (184429), and SOX3 (313430) show the closest homology to SRY. They share maximum homology within the HMG domain and are expressed mainly in the developing nervous system of the mouse (Collignon et al., 1996).

There are 2 major families of nucleoside transporters, the concentrative and the equilibrative.

These lipid mediators are pleiotropic; among the most common cellular responses are mitogenesis, cell survival (antiapoptosis), inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, and calcium mobilization. Physiologic events associated with these mediators include platelet aggregation, vasopressor activity, wound healing, immune modulation, and angiogenesis. Many of the actions of LPA and S1P are mediated through a set of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), including EDG2 (Chun et al., 2002). <br>

602289=><br> Transcriptional repression is a general mechanism for regulating transcriptional initiation in organisms ranging from yeast to humans. Accurate initiation of transcription from eukaryotic protein-encoding genes requires the assembly of a large multiprotein complex consisting of RNA polymerase II (see 180660) and general transcription factors such as TFIIA (see 600519, 600520), TFIIB (see 189963), and TFIID (see 313650). DR1 (601482) is a repressor that interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP; 600075) of TFIID and prevents the formation of an active transcription complex by precluding the entry of TFIIA and/or TFIIB into the preinitiation complex. The DR1-associated protein DRAP1 is a corepressor of transcription that interacts with DR1 to enhance DR1-mediated repression (Mermelstein et al., 1996). The interaction between DRAP1 and DR1 is required for corepressor function and appears to stabilize the TBP-DR1-DNA complex. <br>

602568=><br> The MTRR gene encodes methionine synthase reductase (EC 2.1.1.135). Methionine is an essential amino acid in mammals. It is required for protein synthesis and is a central player in 1-carbon metabolism. In its activated form, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), it is the methyl donor in hundreds of biologic transmethylation reactions and the donor of propylamine in polyamine synthesis. The eventual product of the demethylation of methionine is homocysteine, and its remethylation is catalyzed by a cobalamin-dependent enzyme, methionine synthase (MTR; 156570). Over time, the cob(I)alamin cofactor of methionine synthase becomes oxidized to cob(II)alamin, rendering the MTR enzyme inactive. Regeneration of functional enzyme requires reductive methylation via a reaction catalyzed by MTRR in which SAM is used as a methyl donor (Leclerc et al., 1998). <br>

602579=><br> Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) are a genetically heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders caused by enzymatic defects in the synthesis and processing of asparagine (N)-linked glycans or oligosaccharides on glycoproteins. Type I CDGs comprise defects in the assembly of the dolichol lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) chain and its transfer to the nascent protein. These disorders can be identified by a characteristic abnormal isoelectric focusing profile of plasma transferrin (Leroy, 2006). <br> For a discussion of the classification of CDGs, see CDG1A (212065). <br> CDG Ib is clinically distinct from most other CDGs by the lack of significant central nervous system involvement. The predominant symptoms are chronic diarrhea with failure to thrive and protein-losing enteropathy with coagulopathy. Some patients develop hepatic fibrosis. CDG Ib is also different from other CDGs in that it can be treated effectively with oral mannose supplementation, but can be fatal if untreated (Marquardt and Denecke, 2003). Thus, CDG Ib should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with unexplained hypoglycemia, chronic diarrhea, liver disease, or coagulopathy in order to allow early diagnosis and effective therapy (Vuillaumier-Barrot et al., 2002) <br> Freeze and Aebi (1999) reviewed CDG Ib and CDG Ic (603147). <br>

PAKs are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cytoskeletal dynamics, cell motility, gene transcription, death and survival signaling, and cell cycle progression. Consequently, PAKs are implicated in numerous pathologic conditions and in cell transformation. The PAK family is divided into 2 subfamilies, group I and group II, based on domain architecture and regulation. Group I, the conventional PAKs, includes PAK1, PAK2 (605022), and PAK3 (300142), which are activated upon binding the GTP-bound forms of the Rho GTPases CDC42 (116952) and RAC1 (602048).

Intermediate conductance (IK) and small conductance (SK) channels are gated solely by internal calcium ions, with a unit conductance of 20 to 85 pS and 2 to 20 pS, respectively, and are more sensitive to calcium than are BK channels. Each type of channel shows a distinct pharmacology. KCNN4 belongs to a family of IK and SK channels (Ishii et al., 1997). <br>

M33, a mouse homolog of polycomb, was isolated by means of the structural similarity of its chromodomain (Pearce et al., 1992).

602961=><br> The modification of proteins with ubiquitin is an important cellular mechanism for targeting abnormal or short-lived proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome. At least 3 classes of enzymes are involved in the conjugation of ubiquitin to proteins. Ubiquitin-activating enzymes (e.g., UBE1; 314370), or E1s, are responsible for ATP-dependent charging of ubiquitin through formation of a high-energy thiol ester bond between the C terminus of ubiquitin and a cysteine within itself. The thiol ester-linked ubiquitin is transferred from E1 to a cysteine residue in a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, or E2. E2 enzymes, either by themselves or in combination with ubiquitin-protein ligases (e.g., UBE3A; 601623), or E3s, then transfer ubiquitin monomers or multiubiquitin chains to target proteins, where stable isopeptide linkages are formed. The genome of S. cerevisiae contains at least 10 different E2s, including the closely related UBC4 and UBC5. UBE2D1 encodes a human homolog of S. cerevisiae UBC4 and UBC5. E2s that are highly similar to yeast UBC4 and UBC5 have also been identified in such diverse organisms as Arabidopsis thaliana (UBC8), Drosophila (UbcD1), and C. elegans (ubc2) (Scheffner et al., 1994). <br>

MAPK cascades consist of a 3-kinase module composed of an MAPK, an MAPK kinase (MAPKK), and an MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK). At least 3 distinct MAPK cascades exist in mammals: one leads to the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs; e.g., 601795); another leads to the activation of the p38s (e.g., 602898); and a third leads to the activation of the c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs; e.g., JNK1, 601158). JNKs stimulate the transcriptional activity of c-jun (JUN; 165160) in response to growth factors, proinflammatory cytokines, and certain environmental stresses, such as short wavelength UV light and osmotic shock (summary by Wu et al., 1997). <br>

Drusen, pale excrescences of variable size, and other deposits accumulate below the RPE on the Bruch membrane; clinical and histopathologic investigations have shown that these extracellular deposits are the hallmark of early ARMD. As ARMD advances, areas of geographic atrophy of the RPE can cause visual loss, or choroidal neovascularization can occur to cause wet, or exudative, ARMD with accompanying central visual loss (summary by De et al., 2007). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Age-Related Macular Degeneration <br> The form of ARMD susceptibility designated ARMD1 is associated with variation in the HMCN1 gene.

A commonly accepted clinical classification (Harding, 1993) divides ADCAs into 3 different groups based on the presence or absence of associated symptoms such as brainstem signs or retinopathy. The presence of pyramidal and extrapyramidal symptoms and ophthalmoplegia makes the diagnosis of ADCA I, the presence of retinopathy points to ADCA II, and the absence of associated signs to ADCA III.

604169=><br> Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is characterized by numerous prominent trabeculations and deep intertrabecular recesses in hypertrophied and hypokinetic segments of the left ventricle (Sasse-Klaassen et al., 2004). The mechanistic basis is thought to be an intrauterine arrest of myocardial development with lack of compaction of the loose myocardial meshwork. LVNC may occur in isolation or in association with congenital heart disease. Distinctive morphologic features can be recognized on 2-dimensional echocardiography (Kurosaki et al., 1999). Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium is sometimes referred to as spongy myocardium. Stollberger et al. (2002) commented that the term 'isolated LVNC,' meaning LVNC without coexisting cardiac abnormalities, is misleading, because additional cardiac abnormalities are found in nearly all patients with LVNC. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Left Ventricular Noncompaction <br> A locus for autosomal dominant left ventricular noncompaction has been identified on chromosome 11p15 (LVNC2; 609470). <br> LVNC3 (see 605906) is caused by mutation in the LDB3 gene on chromosome 10q22.2-q23.3.

SIGLECs have similar structures, including extracellular Ig-like domains composed of an N-terminal V-set domain followed by varying numbers of C2-set domains. It appears that all SIGLECs have an unusual arrangement of conserved cysteine residues in the V-set and adjacent C2-set domains. Most SIGLECs are expressed uniquely within the hematopoietic system (Cornish et al., 1998). <br>
604201=><br> Hepatointestinal schistosomiasis is caused by 2 species of helminths: Schistosoma japonicum, which is prevalent in Asia, and S. mansoni, which is prevalent in Africa and South America. Both worms develop in the host mesenteric system and lay eggs that trigger inflammation in the hepatic periportal space in which they are trapped. Worms live for years, and chronic liver inflammation and significant tissue destruction are therefore common in infected individuals. Tissue repair begins with deposition of extracellular matrix proteins (ECMPs) in the damaged tissues, which are later replaced by normal hepatocytes. In some individuals, ECMPs accumulate in the periportal space, forming fibrosis deposits that reduce blood flow and cause varicose veins. These individuals may die from the subsequent effects of hepatic fibrosis. About 5 to 10% of the 350 million infected individuals develop severe hepatic fibrosis. Development of hepatic fibrosis in schistosome-infected individuals is influenced by a locus on chromosome 6q23, designated SM2, which contains 2 major candidate genes: IFNGR1 (107470), which encodes a chain of the receptor for interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570), and CTGF (121009), which encodes a profibrogenic molecule produced by hepatocytes (summary by Dessein et al., 2009). <br>
604202=><br> Intracellular membrane traffic appears to be regulated in part by SNAREs, SNAP (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-attachment protein; see SNAP-alpha, 603215) receptors, through the formation of complexes between SNAREs on vesicle and target membranes. In the nerve terminal, the core fusion complex is a parallel bundle of 4 helices formed from the coiled-coil domains of 3 proteins. Two helices are contributed by the SNAP25 (600322) plasma membrane protein, and 1 helix each comes from a vesicle SNARE, or VAMP, and a target membrane SNARE, or syntaxin. Dissociation of the core complex is mediated by recruitment of the NSF (601633) ATPase chaperone and SNAP-alpha to the complex, followed by ATP hydrolysis, thereby allowing the components to recycle for another round of membrane fusion. <br>

GEFS+ occurs in a small proportion of children with febrile seizures who either have febrile seizures extending beyond age 6 years or develop epilepsy with afebrile seizures. Patients with GEFS+ express a highly variable phenotype combining febrile seizures, generalized seizures often precipitated by fever at age 6 years or more, absence seizures, partial seizures, myoclonic seizures, or atonic seizures, with a variable degree of severity (summary by Wallace et al., 1998). <br> Deprez et al.

Drosophila embryos homozygous for snail or twist mutations form no ventral furrow, fail to develop a mesoderm layer, and die early in embryogenesis. While twist functions as a positive regulator of mesoderm-specific genes, snail acts as a boundary repressor by downregulating the expression of ectodermal genes within the mesoderm. Snail is a member of the Drosophila Snail family of proteins. In vertebrates, only 2 members of the snail family of proteins are known, Snail and Slug (602150); see Sefton et al. (1998).

604399=><br> Midbrain dopaminergic neurons play a critical role in multiple brain functions, and abnormal signaling through dopaminergic pathways has been implicated in several major neurologic and psychiatric disorders. One well-studied target for the actions of dopamine is DARPP32. In the densely dopamine- and glutamate-innervated rat caudate-putamen, DARPP32 is expressed in medium-sized spiny neurons (Ouimet and Greengard, 1990) that also express dopamine D1 receptors (Walaas and Greengard, 1984). The function of DARPP32 seems to be regulated by receptor stimulation. Both dopaminergic and glutamatergic (NMDA) receptor stimulation regulate the extent of DARPP32 phosphorylation, but in opposite directions (Halpain et al., 1990). Dopamine D1 receptor stimulation enhances cAMP formation, resulting in the phosphorylation of DARPP32 (Walaas and Greengard, 1984); phosphorylated DARPP32 is a potent protein phosphatase-1 (see 176875) inhibitor (Hemmings et al., 1984). NMDA receptor stimulation elevates intracellular calcium, which leads to activation of calcineurin and dephosphorylation of phospho-DARPP32, thereby reducing the phosphatase-1 inhibitory activity of DARPP32 (Halpain et al., 1990). <br>

GM3, a plasma membrane glycosphingolipid, participates in induction of differentiation, modulation of proliferation, maintenance of fibroblast morphology, signal transduction, and integrin-mediated cell adhesion. ST3GAL5 (EC 2.4.99.9) is responsible for the synthesis of GM3 (Ishii et al., 1998). <br>
604403=><br> Mutations in the SCN1A gene cause a spectrum of seizure disorders, ranging from early-onset isolated febrile seizures to generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, type 2, which represents a more severe phenotype.

Dravet syndrome (607208), or severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, is the most severe phenotype associated with SCN1A mutations. <br> Mutations in certain genes can cause a phenotypic spectrum of overlap between the isolated febrile phenotype and the GEFS+ phenotype.

The constitutive proteins include CENPA (centromere protein A; 117139), CENPB (117140), CENPC1 (117141), and CENPD (117142). The term 'passenger proteins' encompasses a broad collection of proteins that localize to the centromere during specific stages of the cell cycle (Earnshaw and Mackay, 1994). These include CENPE (117143); MCAK (604538); KID (603213); cytoplasmic dynein (e.g., 600112); CliPs (e.g., 179838); and CENPF/mitosin (600236). The inner centromere proteins (INCENPs) (Earnshaw and Cooke, 1991), the initial members of the passenger protein group, display a broad localization along chromosomes in the early stages of mitosis but gradually become concentrated at centromeres as the cell cycle progresses into mid-metaphase. During telophase, the proteins are located within the midbody in the intercellular bridge, where they are discarded after cytokinesis (Cutts et al., 1999). <br>

604586=><br> Many components have been implicated in the docking and/or fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. Of these components, syntaxin plays a central role by interacting with many other components, including SNAP25 (600322), VAMP (e.g., 603177), synaptotagmin (e.g., 185605), and alpha-SNAP (603215); all of these proteins are present in the 7S and/or 20S complexes. The formation of the 7S and 20S complexes, which occurs sequentially, is a crucial step in synaptic vesicle docking and/or membrane fusion. Syntaxin-1, which includes the isoforms syntaxin-1A (186590) and syntaxin-1B (601485), also forms a heterodimer with MUNC18 (e.g., 602926) in a complex that is distinct from the 7S and 20S complexes. Among known syntaxin-1-binding proteins, MUNC18 interacts with syntaxin-1A with the highest affinity. This interaction is so stable that other syntaxin-1-binding proteins are unable to disrupt it. Thus, MUNC18 plays an inhibitory role in the formation of the 7S complex. STXBP5, or tomosyn, is a brain-specific syntaxin-1-binding protein that can displace MUNC18 from syntaxin-1. <br>

604772=><br> Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an arrhythmogenic disorder of the heart characterized by a reproducible form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia induced by physical activity, stress, or catecholamine infusion, which can deteriorate into ventricular fibrillation. Patients present with recurrent syncope, seizures, or sudden death after physical activity or emotional stress. Typically, clinical cardiologic examinations, such as baseline ECG and echocardiogram, reveal mostly normal findings, and postmortem examinations, when carried out, have not disclosed any significant morphologic alterations in the fine structure of the heart, with the exception of mild fatty myocardial infiltration in a few patients. The hallmark of CPVT comprises ventricular arrhythmias of varying morphology not present under resting conditions but appearing only with physical exercise, excitement, or catecholamine administration. These arrhythmias are first seen as ventricular premature complexes, later in bigeminy, followed by bidirectional or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, which eventually leads to ventricular fibrillation. CPVT can be inherited as an autosomal dominant or recessive trait. Clinical penetrance in this disease ranges from 25 to 100%, with an average of 70 to 80%. Syncope appears to be the first symptom in more than half of the patients. When untreated, mortality from CPVT is high, reaching 30 to 50% by the age of 30 years. Beta-blockers without sympathomimetic activity are clinically effective in the reduction of syncope, but implantation of an automatic internal defibrillator is occasionally needed in these patients (summary by Bhuiyan et al., 2007). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia <br> An autosomal recessive form of the disorder (CPVT2; 611938) is caused by mutation in the calsequestrin-2 gene (CASQ2; 114251).

Multiple PCDHA mRNAs are produced by splicing a single variable exon to 3 constant region exons. Each variable exon is preceded by a promoter and encodes 6 cadherin-like ectodomains, a transmembrane domain, and a portion of the cytoplasmic domain. The constant region exons encode the remainder of the cytoplasmic domain (Ribich et al., 2006). <br>

GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) bind activated forms of Rho GTPases and stimulate GTP hydrolysis. Through this catalytic function, Rho GAPs negatively regulate Rho-mediated signals.

Members of the PAK subfamily (see PAK3; 300142) contain a C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain that has a CDC42 (116952)-binding domain. In contrast, members of the GCK subfamily (see MAP4K2; 603166), also called the Sps1 subfamily, have an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain without a CDC42-binding domain. STK24 belongs to the GCK subfamily of STE20-like kinases (Zhou et al., 2000). <br>

These cells are studded with microvilli containing bundles of actin filaments, which must attach to the membrane to assemble and maintain the microvilli. The ERM proteins, together with merlin, the NF2 (607379) gene product, are thought to be linkers between integral membrane and cytoskeletal proteins, and they bind directly to actin in vitro. Actin cytoskeleton reorganization requires the activation of a sodium/hydrogen exchanger (SLC9A3; 182307). SLC9A3R1 is an ERM-binding protein. <br>

However, covalent attachment of UBLs does not result in degradation of the modified proteins. SUMO1 modification is implicated in the targeting of RANGAP1 (602362) to the nuclear pore complex, as well as in stabilization of I-kappa-B-alpha (NFKBIA; 164008) from degradation by the 26S proteasome. Like ubiquitin, UBLs are synthesized as precursor proteins, with 1 or more amino acids following the C-terminal glycine-glycine residues of the mature UBL protein. Thus, the tail sequences of the UBL precursors need to be removed by UBL-specific proteases, such as SENP6, prior to their conjugation to target proteins (Kim et al., 2000). SENPs also display isopeptidase activity for deconjugation of SUMO-conjugated substrates (Lima and Reverter, 2008). <br>

The yeast 'sterile 20' (Ste20) kinase acts upstream of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade that is activated under a variety of stress conditions. MST2 was identified as a kinase that is activated by the proapoptotic agents straurosporine and FAS ligand (134638) (Taylor et al., 1996; Lee et al., 2001). <br>

605032=><br> The highly specialized uptake and exocytosis system of synaptic vesicle traffic has been studied extensively as a model of membrane fusion. The fusion reaction begins with the assembly of a core complex consisting of the plasma membrane proteins syntaxin (e.g., STX1A; 186590) and SNAP25 (600322) and the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin (e.g., VAMP2; 185881). The core complex then serves as a soluble NSF attachment protein (SNAP; see 603215) receptor, or SNARE. Binding of SNAP to SNARE leads to ATP-dependent binding of NSF (601633), which subsequently catalyzes disruption of the SNARE complex. Synaptotagmin (e.g., SYT1; 185605) triggers the final step in the fusion process, possibly via Ca(2+)-dependent interaction with syntaxin. Complexins, such as CPLX1, are soluble proteins that regulate SNARE function during membrane fusion (McMahon et al., 1995). <br>

These proteins contain a C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a central 200-amino acid region similar to a domain within the yeast Sec7 protein, which is required for vesicular traffic of polypeptides through the Golgi (Franco et al., 1998). <br>

May-Hegglin anomaly (155100) shares the same triad as Sebastian syndrome, but has a different ultrastructural appearance of the leukocyte inclusions. In May-Hegglin anomaly, the inclusions are composed of clusters of ribosomes oriented along parallel microfilaments, whereas in Sebastian syndrome, the leukocyte inclusions are composed of highly dispersed filaments and few ribosomes. Fechtner syndrome (153640) has the platelet defect accompanied by nephritis, hearing loss, and eye abnormalities, mostly cataracts. Epstein syndrome (153650) had the platelet defect, deafness, and nephritis, but does not have cataract and lacks leukocyte inclusion bodies on classic staining of peripheral blood smears. The findings of nephritis, hearing loss, and occasional cataracts in Fechtner and Epstein syndromes are reminiscent of Alport syndrome (301050). Seri et al. (2003) suggested that these 4 disorders, May-Hegglin, Sebastian, Epstein, and Fechtner syndromes, are not distinct entities, but rather represent a single disorder with a continuous clinical spectrum, for which they proposed the term 'MYH9-related disease.' However, other disorders, e.g., macrothrombocytopenia and progressive sensorineural deafness (600208) and a form of nonsyndromic deafness (DFNA17; 603622), are also caused by mutation in the MYH9 gene. <br>

Chromatin can become alternatively transparent or opaque to transcription factors. Acetylation (see HAT1; 603053) of lysine residues induces conformational changes in core histones by destabilizing nucleosomes and allowing transcription factors access to recognition elements in DNA. Deacetylation (see HDAC1; 601241) of histones, on the other hand, reseals the chromosomal package, leading to a repression of transcription. See Wolffe (1997) and Pazin and Kadonaga (1997) for reviews. There are at least 2 classes of HDACs, class I consisting of proteins homologous to yeast Rpd3 (e.g., HDAC1, HDAC2 (605164), and HDAC3 (605166)) and class II consisting of proteins homologous to yeast Hda1.

605462=><br> Cutaneous basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common cancer among people of European ancestry (Stacey et al., 2009). The primary environmental risk factor for BCC is sun exposure, but genetics also has a substantial role. Some of the sequence variants that confer susceptibility seem to operate through their association with fair-pigmentation traits common among Europeans, resulting in reduced protection from the damaging effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Other sequence variants have no obvious role in pigmentation or UV susceptibility but instead seem to operate in the contexts of growth and differentiation of the basal layers of the skin (Stacey et al., 2008; Epstein, 2008; Gudbjartsson et al., 2008; Rafnar et al., 2009). See ASIP (600201), TYR (606933), and SHEP5 (227240) for examples of basal cell carcinoma associated with fair skin or sensitivity to sun. <br> Basal cell carcinoma occurs as a feature of multiple syndromes, including basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS; 109400), Bazex syndrome (301845), Rombo syndrome (180730), Brooke-Spiegler syndrome (605041), Muir-Torre syndrome (158320), and xeroderma pigmentosum (see 278700). <br> Abnormalities in the Hedgehog signaling pathway are found in basal cell carcinomas; see SHH (600725) and SMOH (601500). <br>

605546=><br> Glycoprotein VI (GP6) is a 58-kD platelet membrane glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in the collagen-induced activation and aggregation of platelets. Upon injury to the vessel wall and subsequent damage to the endothelial lining, exposure of the subendothelial matrix to blood flow results in deposition of platelets. Collagen fibers are the most thrombogenic macromolecular components of the extracellular matrix, with collagen types I, III, and VI being the major forms found in blood vessels. Platelet interaction with collagen occurs as a 2-step procedure: (1) the initial adhesion to collagen is followed by (2) an activation step leading to platelet secretion, recruitment of additional platelets, and aggregation. In physiologic conditions, the resulting platelet plug is the initial hemostatic event limiting blood loss. However, exposure of collagen after rupture of atherosclerotic plaques is a major stimulus of thrombus formation associated with myocardial infarction or stroke (Jandrot-Perrus et al., 2000). <br>

The syndrome may affect nearly 1 in 4 U.S. adults and is considered a veritable epidemic (Ford et al., 2002). It is a major risk factor for both diabetes mellitus (see 125853 and Haffner et al., 1992) and cardiovascular disease (Isomaa et al., 2001). The etiology is complex, determined by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors. The prevalence varies substantially among ethnic groups, with the highest rates in Mexican American women (Park et al., 2003). Other factors influencing the metabolic syndrome include age, smoking, alcohol, diet, and physical inactivity. <br>

Calcineurin has also been shown to have a profound influence on the properties of striated muscle cells, including cardiac muscle. To identify potential cardiac-specific regulators of calcineurin, Frey et al. (2000) conducted a yeast 2-hybrid screen, using the catalytic A subunit of calcineurin as bait. They identified a novel family of striated muscle-specific calcineurin-interacting proteins called calsarcins. Calsarcins interact and colocalize with the Z disc protein alpha-actinin (ACTN1; 102575) in vitro and in vivo and thereby tether calcineurin to the sarcomere of cardiac and skeletal muscle. These properties of calsarcins suggest an important role for these proteins in modulating the function and substrate specificity of calcineurin in striated muscle cells. <br>

606176=><br> Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM), defined as insulin-requiring hyperglycemia within the first 3 months of life, is a rare entity, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 400,000 neonates (Shield, 2000). In about half of the neonates, diabetes is transient (see 601410) and resolves at a median age of 3 months, whereas the rest have a permanent insulin-dependent form of diabetes (PNDM). In a significant number of patients with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus, type II diabetes (see 125853) appears later in life (Arthur et al., 1997). PNDM is distinct from childhood-onset autoimmune diabetes mellitus type I (IDDM; 222100). <br> Mutations in the PTF1A gene (607194) cause pancreatic agenesis leading to permanent neonatal-onset diabetes mellitus associated with cerebellar agenesis (609069). Mutation in the IPF1 gene (600733) can also cause pancreatic agenesis. <br> Massa et al. (2005) noted that the diagnostic time limit for PNDM has changed over the years, ranging from onset within 30 days of birth to 3 months of age. However, as patients with the clinical phenotype caused by mutation in the KCNJ11 gene have been identified with onset up to 6 months of age, Massa et al. (2005) suggested that the term 'permanent diabetes mellitus of infancy' (PDMI) replace PNDM as a more accurate description, and include those who present up to 6 months of age. The authors suggested that the new acronym be linked to the gene product (e.g., GCK-PDMI, KCNJ11-PDMI) to avoid confusion with patients with early-onset, autoimmune type I diabetes. <br> Colombo et al. (2008) proposed that, because individuals with INS gene mutations may present with diabetes well beyond 6 months of age and cannot be distinguished from patients with type 1 diabetes except for the absence of type 1 diabetes autoantibodies, the term PNDM should be replaced with 'monogenic diabetes of infancy (MDI),' a broad definition including any form of diabetes, permanent or transient, with onset during the first years of life and caused by a single gene defect. <br>

606255=><br> Stature (adult height) is an example of a complex genetic trait involving multiple genetic loci. Although complex traits are often difficult to study by linkage analysis, Hirschhorn et al. (2001) suggested that stature is a suitable complex trait for study because of the high heritability and the relatively limited contribution of environmental factors. Thus, linkage analysis has been used to identify quantitative trait loci for stature (STQTL) including STQTL1 on chromosome 6q24, STQTL2 (606256) on chromosome 7q31-q36, STQTL3 (606257) on chromosome 12p11-q14, STQTL4 (606258) on chromosome 13q32-q33, STQTL5 (608982) on chromosome 3p26, STQTL6 (300591) on chromosome Xq24, STQTL7 (609822) on chromosome 1p21, STQTL8 (610114) on chromosome 9q22, STQTL9 (611547) on chromosome 12q14.3, STQTL10 (612221) on chromosome 3q23, STQTL11 (612223) on chromosome 7q21-q22, STQTL12 (612224) on chromosome 4q28-q32, STQTL13 (612226) on chromosome 4p13.3, STQTL14 (612228) on chromosome 20q11.22, STQTL15 (612578) on chromosome 8q21.13, STQTL16 (612579) on chromosome 15q22.31, STQTL17 (612737) on chromosome 7p15, STQTL18 (612892) on chromosome 6p22.1, STQTL19 (612893) on chromosome 6p21.31, STQTL20 (612894) on chromosome 13q14.3, STQTL21 (613440) on chromosome 2q37.1, STQTL22 (613547) on chromosome 16q24, STQTL23 (613548) on chromosome 1p32, and STQTL24 (613549) on chromosome 2p16. <br> See also X-linked short stature (300582) associated with mutations in the SHOX gene (312865), and autosomal short stature (604271) for a discussion of short stature associated with mutations in growth hormone-related genes. <br>

606448=><br> Thioredoxin reductases (EC 1.6.4.5), such as TXNRD2, are selenocysteine (sec)-containing flavoenzymes that maintain thioredoxins, small proteins that catalyze redox reactions, in the reduced state using the reducing power of NADPH. The sec residue, which is essential for enzyme activity, is located in the penultimate C-terminal position and is encoded by a UGA codon. Sec differs from cys in that it substitutes selenium, a better nucleophile, for sulfur. Termination of polypeptide synthesis is prevented by a stem-loop structure called the selenocysteine insertion sequence, or SECIS, which is located in the 3-prime UTR (Gasdaska et al., 1999; Sun et al., 1999). <br>

CMT1, or hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type I (HMSN I), is a demyelinating neuropathy, whereas CMT2, or HMSN II, is an axonal neuropathy. Most patients with CMT are classified as having CMT1 or CMT2 by use of a cut-off value of 38 m/s for the motor median nerve conduction velocity (NCV). However, in some families with CMT, patients have motor median NCVs ranging from 25 to 45 m/s. Families of this type were reported by Salisachs (1974) and Davis et al. (1978). Davis et al. (1978) proposed that this form be designated 'intermediate' CMT. <br> Claeys et al. (2009) stated that some CMT families may have an even broader range of NCV than 25 to 45 m/s, with the lowest levels around 25 and the highest levels within the normal range (50+ m/s). They also suggested that the term 'intermediate' should not be used to describe a single NCV value, but rather the CMT subtype at the level of the family (e.g., in families with a range or combinations of NCV values). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Autosomal Dominant Intermediate

Onset of seizures, usually characterized by apneic episodes, staring spells, and episodic eye movements, occurs within the first 4 months of life. Other paroxysmal findings include intermittent ataxia, confusion, lethargy, sleep disturbance, and headache. Varying degrees of cognitive impairment can occur, ranging from learning disabilities to severe mental retardation. Hypoglycorrhachia (low CSF glucose, less than 40 mg/dl) and low CSF lactate are essentially diagnostic for the disorder. As more cases with GLUT1 deficiency syndrome are described, the phenotype has broadened to include individuals with ataxia and mental retardation but without seizures, individuals with dystonia and choreoathetosis, and rare individuals with absence seizures and no movement disorder. The disorder, which results from a defect in the GLUT1 glucose transporter causing decreased glucose concentration in the central nervous system, is part of a spectrum of neurologic phenotypes resulting from GLUT1 deficiency. GLUT deficiency syndrome-2 (612126) represents the less severe end of the phenotypic spectrum and is associated with paroxysmal exercise-induced dystonia with or without seizures. Correct diagnosis of GLUT1 deficiency is important because a ketogenic diet often results in marked clinical improvement of the motor and seizure symptoms (reviews by Pascual et al., 2004 and Brockmann, 2009). <br>

Thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections are primarily associated with a characteristic histologic appearance known as 'medial necrosis' or 'Erdheim cystic medial necrosis' in which there is degeneration and fragmentation of elastic fibers, loss of smooth muscle cells, and an accumulation of basophilic ground substance. In contrast, degeneration leading to abdominal aortic aneurysm (100070) is usually caused by a combination of factors including age, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and infectious, inflammatory, or autoimmune processes. <br> Medial necrosis and thoracic aortic aneurysm/dissection are known to occur in certain connective tissue diseases such as Marfan syndrome (154700), and vascular (type IV) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (130050). More commonly, however, medial necrosis occurs in the absence of a clearly identifiable syndrome. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm <br> Loci for isolated thoracic aortic aneurysm have been identified on chromosomes 11q (AAT1) and 5q (AAT2; 607087). Mutation in the MYH11 gene (160745) on chromosome 16p causes AAT4 (132900). Mutation in the ACTA2 gene (102620) on chromosome 10q causes AAT6 (611788). Mutation in the MYLK gene (600922) on chromosome 3q21 causes AAT7 (613780).

607411=><br> Persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus, or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), is the second most common congenital heart disease, affecting approximately 1 in 1,600 to 5,000 live births in the U.S. (Mitchell et al., 1971). In fetal life, the ductus arteriosus, a muscular artery, shunts blood from the pulmonary artery to the aorta, bypassing the lungs. Its abrupt closure at birth establishes the mature circulatory pattern and represents a dramatic example of vascular remodeling. Failure of this normal process results in persistent PDA, which left untreated can result in pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. Closure of the ductus is a complex process. Aspects of this process are regulated by oxygen tension and a decrease in levels of hormones such as prostaglandin E2. PDA occurring in preterm infants often closes spontaneously or in response to inhibitors of prostaglandin biosynthesis (Ramsay et al., 1987). Term PDA typically has not been regarded as a genetic disorder, because it most often occurs sporadically. Nonetheless, term PDA recurs among 5% of sibs of PDA cases (Polani and Campbell, 1960; Lamy et al., 1957), suggesting a genetic component to disease pathogenesis that has typically been presumed to be multifactorial. That single genes can influence this trait has been demonstrated by a mouse model of PDA resulting from disruption of the prostaglandin E2 receptor (Nguyen et al., 1997) and by rare syndromic forms of PDA such as Char syndrome (169100), an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the transcription factor TFAP2B (601601) (Mani et al., 2002). <br>

607432=><br> Lissencephaly (LIS), literally meaning smooth brain, is characterized by smooth or nearly smooth cerebral surface and a paucity of gyral and sulcal development, encompassing a spectrum of brain surface malformations ranging from complete agyria to subcortical band heterotopia (SBH). Classic lissencephaly is associated with an abnormally thick cortex, reduced or abnormal lamination, and diffuse neuronal heterotopia. SBH consists of circumferential bands of heterotopic neurons located just beneath the cortex and separated from it by a thin band of white matter. SBH represents the less severe end of the lissencephaly spectrum of malformations (Pilz et al., 1999, summary by Kato and Dobyns, 2003). Agyria, i.e., brain without convolutions or gyri, was considered a rare malformation until recent progress in neuroradiology (Bordarier et al., 1986). With this technical advantage, a number of lissencephaly syndromes have been distinguished. <br> Classic lissencephaly (formerly type I) is a brain malformation caused by abnormal neuronal migration at 9 to 13 weeks' gestation, resulting in a spectrum of agyria, mixed agyria/pachygyria, and pachygyria. It is characterized by an abnormally thick and poorly organized cortex with 4 primitive layers, diffuse neuronal heterotopia, enlarged and dysmorphic ventricles, and often hypoplasia of the corpus callosum.

Other variations of the phenotype have been referred to as 'dysphasic disinhibition dementia' and 'primary progressive aphasia' (PPA) (Huey et al., 2006; Mukherjee et al., 2006; Mesulam et al., 2007). Some patients may present with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300) or Parkinson disease (PD; 168600), which are part of the phenotypic spectrum of this disorder (Brouwers et al., 2007). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of FTLD-TDP  <br> The specific presence of TDP43 (TARDBP; 605078)-positive inclusions on neuropathologic examination defines a genetically heterogenous group of dementias known collectively as 'FTLD-TDP.' FTLD-TDP is a neuropathologic diagnosis; only about 20% of patients with this neuropathologic diagnosis have GRN mutations (review by Van Deerlin et al., 2010). <br> FTLD-TDP can also be caused by mutation in the TARDBP gene (see ALS10; 612069) and the VCP gene (IBMPFD; 167320). In addition, a locus for FTLD-TDP has been mapped to chromosome 9p (105550). <br> Mackenzie and Rademakers (2007) provided a detailed review of the molecular genetics of FTLD, with special emphasis on FTLDU.

607578=><br> The diagnosis of severe breath-holding spells (BHS) in childhood is based on a distinctive and stereotyped sequence of clinical events beginning with a provocation resulting in crying or emotional upset that leads to a noiseless state of expiration accompanied by color change and ultimately loss of consciousness and postural tone (Lombroso and Lerman, 1967; DiMario, 1992). Two clinical types are recognized based on the child's coloration (cyanotic or pallid) during these events. Most children experience the cyanotic type, although some experience mixed types. BHS is an involuntary, nonvolitional, reflexic, nonepileptic paroxysmal phenomenon of childhood. The episodes occur during full expiration despite its misnomer.

Cysteine is considered a nonessential amino acid because it can be synthesized in the body in this way. Biosynthesized cysteine is further metabolized in the liver to yield glutathione and taurine (summary by Ishii et al., 2010). <br>

JMML constitutes approximately 30% of childhood cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and 2% of leukemia (Hasle et al., 1999). Although JMML is a progressive and often rapidly fatal disease without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), some patients have been shown to have a prolonged and stable clinical course without HSCT (Niemeyer et al., 1997). Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a similar disorder with later onset. Both JMML and CMML have a high frequency of mutations affecting the RAS signaling pathway and show hypersensitivity to stimulation with GM-CSF, which causes STAT5 (601511) hyperphosphorylation (Loh et al., 2009). <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity of Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia <br> In up to 60% of cases of JMML, the RAS/MAPK pathway is deregulated due to somatic mutations in the PTPN11, KRAS, and NRAS genes. Additionally, both germline and somatic mutations in the CBL gene have been found in patients with JMML, indicating a frequency of 10 to 15% of JMML patients overall (Loh et al., 2009). Somatic disruptions of the GRAF gene (ARHGAP26; 605370) have also been found in patients with JMML. <br> About 10 to 15% of JMML cases arise in children with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1; 162200) due to germline mutations in the NF1 gene (613113).

Genetic factors are thought to contribute to 40 to 60% of trait variance. Molecular genetics has tried to identify specific genes for quantitative traits, called quantitative trait loci (QTLs). The QTL concept suggests that complex personality traits or dimensions are not attributable to single genes, but to multiple interacting genes (Reif and Lesch, 2003). <br> Fullerton et al. (2003) stated that psychologists were in agreement that the wide variation in human personalities can be explained by a small number of personality factors, including neuroticism (a measure of emotional stability), which manifests at one extreme as anxiety, depression, moodiness, low self-esteem, and diffidence. They cited a number of studies that had described a relationship between high scores on measures of neuroticism and major depressive disorder. They also noted that theoretical studies had suggested that large samples of randomly ascertained sibs could be used to ascertain phenotypically extreme individuals and thereby increase power to detect genetic linkage in complex traits. <br> See also panic disorder (PAND1; 167870), which is a subtype of anxiety disorder. <br>

CASP12 belongs to the inflammatory caspase subfamily and is expressed in all mammals except humans, where it has acquired multiple mutations. Most notably, a SNP introduces a premature stop codon in exon 4 in the majority of the population. However, in 20% of African descendants, an arginine replaces the premature stop codon in exon 4 (608633.0001), allowing expression of a full-length CASP12 protein.

608638=><br> Asperger syndrome is considered to be a form of childhood autism (see, e.g., 209850). The DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) specifies several diagnostic criteria for Asperger syndrome, which has many of the same features as autism. In general, patients with Asperger syndrome and autism exhibit qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifest by impairment in the use of nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures, failure to develop appropriate peer relationships, and lack of social sharing or reciprocity. Patients also exhibit restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, including abnormal preoccupation with certain activities and inflexible adherence to routines or rituals. Asperger syndrome is primarily distinguished from autism by the higher cognitive abilities and a more normal and timely development of language and communicative phrases. Gillberg et al. (2001) described the development of the Asperger syndrome (and high-functioning autism) Diagnostic Interview (ASDI), which they claimed has a strong validity in the diagnosis of the disorder. <br> Forms of Asperger syndrome have been mapped to chromosome 3q (ASPG1), chromosome 17p (ASPG2; 608631), and chromosome 1q21-q22 (ASPG3; 608781). Two X-linked forms, ASPGX1 (300494) and ASPGX2 (300497), are associated with mutation in the NLGN3 gene (300336) and the NLGN4 gene (300427), respectively. <br>

Kartagener (pronounced KART-agayner) syndrome is characterized by the combination of primary ciliary dyskinesia and situs inversus, and occurs in approximately half of patients with ciliary dyskinesia. Since normal nodal ciliary movement in the embryo is required for normal visceral asymmetry, absence of normal ciliary movement results in a lack of definitive patterning; thus, random chance alone appears to determine whether the viscera take up the normal or reversed left-right position during embryogenesis. This explains why approximately 50% of patients, even within the same family, have situs inversus (Afzelius, 1976; El Zein et al., 2003). <br>

The disorder is not inherited in a classic mendelian pattern; it rather represents a phenotype with a complex etiology. Affected individuals may have genetic susceptibility factors that require the additional presence of environmental factors or acquired disorders to be expressed (summary by Hegele et al., 2006). Most cases are sporadic, family history is negative, and females are more often affected than males (ratio, 4:1). <br> There is an association between APLD and autoimmune diseases (Misra and Garg, 2003; Misra et al., 2004), and a subset of patients have APLD associated with low serum complement component C3 and the autoantibody C3 nephritic factor, with or without membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (APLDC3; 613913). <br> Acquired partial lipodystrophy is distinct from inherited forms of partial lipodystrophy, which are metabolic disorders that show clear mendelian inheritance (see, e.g., FPLD1, 608600). <br>
608710=><br> Wegener granulomatosis (WG) is a systemic disease with a complex genetic background. It is characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation of the upper and lower respiratory tract, glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, and the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmatic autoantibodies (ANCAs) in patient sera. These ANCAs are antibodies to a defined target antigen, proteinase-3 (PR3; 177020), that is present within primary azurophil granules of neutrophils (PMNs) and lysozymes of monocytes. On cytokine priming of PMNs, PR3 translocates to the cell surface, where PR3-ANCAs can interact with their antigens and activate PMNs. PMNs from patients with active WG express PR3 on their surface, produce respiratory burst, and release proteolytic enzymes after activation with PR3-ANCAs. The consequence is a self-sustaining inflammatory process (Jagiello et al., 2004). <br>

FCCMS is an autosomal recessive form of postsynaptic CMS. For a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of CMS, see 608931. <br> In most cases, FCCMS is caused by recessive gain-of-function mutations that decrease activity of the AChR by slowing the rate of opening of the receptor channel, speeding the rate of closure of the channel, or decreasing the number of openings of the channel during ACh occupancy. The result is failure to achieve threshold depolarization of the endplate and consequent failure to fire an action potential. FCCMS is the physiologic opposite of slow-channel CMS (SCCMS; 601462), but the 2 disorders cause similar phenotypes. Sine et al. (2003) provided a detailed analysis of the mechanistic diversity underlying fast-channel congenital CMS. Autosomal dominant inheritance has rarely been described. <br>

Homozygotes and heterozygotes may show increased susceptibility to meningococcal infections. In addition, a number of renal diseases have been associated with factor H defect or deficiency, including atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS; 235400), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II (MPGN II), and nonspecific hematuria or nephritis (Ault, 2000).

MPGN type II, also known as dense deposit disease, causes chronic renal dysfunction that progresses to end-stage renal disease in about half of patients within 10 years of diagnosis. MPGN types I and III are variants of immune complex-mediated disease; MPGN II, in contrast, has no known association with immune complexes (Appel et al., 2005). MPGN II accounts for less than 20% of cases of MPGN in children and only a fractional percentage of cases in adults. Both sexes are affected equally, with the diagnosis usually made in children between the ages of 5 and 15 years who present with nonspecific findings such as hematuria, proteinuria, acute nephritic syndrome, or nephrotic syndrome. More than 80% of patients with MPGN II are positive for serum C3 nephritic factor (C3NeF), an autoantibody directed against C3bBb, the convertase of the alternative pathway of the complement cascade C3NeF prolongs the half-life of C3 convertase.

609888=><br> Leprosy is a disease of peripheral sensory nerves that results from infection with Mycobacterium leprae, which was first detected in Bergen, Norway, in 1873 by Dr. Armauer Hansen. It can be effectively treated with long-term multidrug therapy. In 2006, more than 250,000 new cases of leprosy were reported to the World Health Organization. Many infected individuals have self-healing indeterminate lesions. Others with initially indeterminate lesions proceed to develop leprosy that can be classified along a clinical and immunologic spectrum from paucibacillary or tuberculoid leprosy to multibacillary or lepromatous leprosy. Most patients fall somewhere between these 2 polar forms of the disease and are classified, using pathology-based criteria developed by Ridley and Jopling (1966), as borderline tuberculoid, midborderline, and borderline lepromatous. The paucibacillary form is associated with strong M. leprae-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI), whereas the multibacillary form is notable for the lack of antigen-specific CMI. The prevalence of paucibacillary versus multibacillary leprosy varies in different populations. M. leprae cannot be cultured in vitro and grows slowly in the footpads of mice, the liver and spleen of armadillos, and in some nonhuman primates. A genetic component to leprosy susceptibility has long been suspected. While contact with a multibacillary patient increases the relative risk of acquiring disease, most new patients have no known contact with other patients.

610446=><br> Buruli ulcer is an infectious disease prevalent in many tropical and subtropical regions caused by infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans. It is the third most frequent mycobacterial disease in humans worldwide, after tuberculosis (607948) and leprosy (246300). Lesions are most common on exposed parts of the body, especially the limbs. Buruli ulcer derives its name from a county in Uganda, East Africa, north of Kampala, where the disease was found in the late 1950s in hundreds of people living near marshes and riverine areas near the Nile River (Clancey et al., 1961; Barker, 1971). The disease was first described in the medical literature in 1948 in a report on patients in Australia (MacCallum et al., 1948). Patients have also been reported from tropical areas in Latin America and Asia (Stienstra et al., 2006; van der Werf et al., 2005). <br>

610460=><br> TPMT deficiency is an autosomal recessive trait associated with severe hematopoietic toxicity when patients are treated with standard doses of the antineoplastic agents 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) or 6-thioguanine (6TG), or the immunosuppressant azathioprine (AZA) (Lennard et al., 1989). <br> The thiopurines are pro-drugs that require extensive metabolism in order to exert their cytotoxic action. Azathioprine is non-enzymatically reduced to 6MP. 6MP and 6TG are activated by HPRT (308000) and subsequent steps to form cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs) which are incorporated into DNA and/or RNA, causing DNA-protein cross-links, single-strand breaks, interstrand cross-links, and sister chromatid exchange. TPMT functions mainly to inactivate these drugs; thus, a deficiency of TPMT results in increased conversion to toxic TGNs, which can result in myelosuppression (Coulthard and Hogarth, 2005). However, 6MP is unique in that it can also be converted via TPMT into a methyl-thioinosine 5-prime monophosphate (MeTIMP), a metabolite that inhibits de novo purine synthesis and likely contributes to the cytotoxic effect of 6MP (Vogt et al., 1993; Krynetski et al., 1995; Coulthard and Hogarth, 2005). <br>

610511=><br> SEC23A is an essential component of coat protein complex II (COPII)-coated vesicles that transport secretory proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex. Formation of the COPII complex is initiated when the small GTPase SAR1 (see SAR1B; 607690) becomes anchored to the cytosolic surface of the ER, which requires GDP/GTP exchange by the integral membrane glycoprotein SEC12. Activated SAR1 directly binds the SEC23-SEC24 (see SEC24A; 607183) complex, a heterodimer required for recognition of cargo proteins in the membrane. Cargo molecules tethered to SAR1 and SEC23-SEC24 are coated by the SEC13 (see SEC13L1; 600152)-SEC31 (see SEC31L1; 610257) complex, forming buds and vesicles destined for the Golgi apparatus. SEC23A also functions as a SAR1-specific GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that hydrolyzes the GTP bound to SAR1, which in turn triggers uncoating of vesicles after budding (summary by Boyadjiev et al., 2006). <br>

610551=><br> Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 is most often associated with infection of the oral mucosa. Primary infection is most commonly asymptomatic, but it may lead to symptoms usually involving the mucosa and skin. Following replication at the infection site, HSV-1 enters the epithelial endings of sensory neurons and travels up the trigeminal cranial nerves to the trigeminal ganglia, where latent infection is established. Reactivation of HSV-1, usually in the form of herpes labialis (cold sores), may occur in 20 to 40% of the population. HSV-1 seroprevalence is high, with over 85% of adults between the ages of 20 and 40 years infected. HSV-1 rarely infects the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), with an incidence of 2 to 4 per 1,000,000 people per year. In HSE, HSV-1 invades and replicates in neurons and glial cells, where focal necrotizing infections occur, primarily affecting the temporal and subfrontal regions of the brain. Untreated, HSE is fatal in at least 70% of cases, although the mortality and morbidity have been drastically reduced with antiviral therapy. Approximately one-third of all HSE cases are due to primary infections, and 30% of all HSE cases occur in children under the age of 20 years. Among children, HSE peaks between 3 months and 3 years of age, coinciding with the time of primary infection. In a subset of children, HSE results from a series of monogenic primary immunodeficiencies that impair UNC93B1- and TLR3 (603029)-dependent production of IFNA (147660)/IFNB (147640) and IFNG (147570) in the CNS (Sancho-Shimizu et al., 2007). <br>

610600=><br> CMO type II deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in the final biochemical step of aldosterone biosynthesis, the 18-hydroxylation of 18-hydroxycorticosterone (18-OHB) to aldosterone. This enzymatic defect results in decreased aldosterone and salt-wasting associated with an increased serum ratio of 18-OHB to aldosterone.

KIR genes cluster in a 150-kb region of chromosome 19q13.4, and the organization of the KIR gene cluster varies extensively among individuals. KIR3DP1 is designated a pseudogene because its RNA is normally undetectable in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

Most forms of OI are autosomal dominant with mutations in one of the 2 genes that code for type I collagen alpha chains, COL1A1 (120150) and COL1A2 (120160). Glorieux et al.

610982=><br> Actin filaments grow only when actin monomers have access to the fast-growing barbed end of the filament. The geometry of the filament network depends on the actions of the ARP2/3 complex (604221) and members of the formin family, such as INF2. The ARP2/3 complex binds to the sides of preexisting filaments and nucleates filaments whose barbed ends are quickly blocked by capping proteins, producing brush-like structures, such as those found at the leading edges of crawling cells. In contrast, formins bind to the barbed ends of growing filaments and protect them from capping, creating long filaments that can be cross-linked into bundles, such as those found in actin cables of yeast. Interaction of formins with actin barbed ends occurs through the formin homology-2 (FH2) domain. FH2 domains accelerate filament nucleation, move with the barbed end as the filament grows, and block capping of the barbed end by proteins such as gelsolin (GSN; 137350). The FH1 domain of formins binds to profilin (see 176610) and accelerates elongation from the FH2-bound barbed ends (Bindschadler and McGrath, 2004; Chhabra and Higgs, 2006). <br>

611162=><br> Malaria, a major cause of child mortality worldwide, is caused by mosquito-borne hematoprotozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium. Of the 4 species that infect humans, P. falciparum causes the most severe forms of malaria and is the major cause of death and disease. Although less fatal, P. malariae, P. ovale, and, in particular, P. vivax infections are major causes of morbidity. The parasite cycle involves a first stage in liver cells and a subsequent stage at erythrocytes, when malaria symptoms occur. A wide spectrum of phenotypes are observed, from asymptomatic infection to mild disease, including fever and mild anemia, to severe disease, including cerebral malaria, profound anemia, and respiratory distress. Genetic factors influence the response to infection, as well as disease progression and severity. Malaria is the strongest known selective pressure in the recent history of the human genome, and it is the evolutionary driving force behind sickle-cell disease (603903), thalassemia (see 141800), glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency (305900), and other erythrocyte defects that together constitute the most common mendelian diseases of humans (Kwiatkowski, 2005; Campino et al., 2006). <br>

Coronary artery aneurysms develop in 15 to 25% of those left untreated (Kato et al., 1975, 1996), making Kawasaki disease the leading cause of acquired heart disease among children in developed countries. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) abrogates the inflammation in approximately 80% of affected individuals and reduces the aneurysm rate to less than 5%. Cardiac sequelae of the aneurysms include ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and sudden death. Epidemiologic features such as seasonality and clustering of cases suggested an infectious trigger, although no pathogen had been isolated. Several lines of evidence suggested the importance of genetic factors in disease susceptibility and outcome. First, the incidence of Kawasaki disease is 10 to 20 times higher in Japan than in Western countries (Cook et al., 1989). Second, the risk of Kawasaki disease in sibs of affected children is 10 times higher than in the general population, and the incidence of Kawasaki disease in children born to parents with a history of Kawasaki disease is twice as high as that in the general population (Fujita et al., 1989; Uehara et al., 2003). <br> Hata and Onouchi (2009) reviewed current knowledge on Kawasaki disease, including epidemiology, genomewide linkage analysis, and molecular genetics. <br>

Kartagener (pronounced KART-agayner) syndrome is characterized by the combination of primary ciliary dyskinesia and situs inversus, and occurs in approximately half of patients with ciliary dyskinesia. Since normal nodal ciliary movement in the embryo is required for normal visceral asymmetry, absence of normal ciliary movement results in a lack of definitive patterning; thus, random chance alone appears to determine whether the viscera take up the normal or reversed left-right position during embryogenesis. This explains why approximately 50% of patients, even within the same family, have situs inversus (Afzelius, 1976; El Zein et al., 2003). <br>

Blood and plasma fasting glucose levels are tightly regulated within a narrow physiologic range by a feedback mechanism that targets a particular fasting glucose set point for each individual (summarized by Prokopenko et al., 2009). Within healthy, nondiabetic populations there is substantial variation in fasting glucose levels. Approximately one-third of this variation is genetic. Disruption of normal glucose homeostasis and substantial elevations of fasting glucose are hallmarks of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and typically result from sustained reduction in pancreatic beta-cell function and insulin secretion. <br> - Genetic Heterogeneity <br> Genetic loci influencing fasting plasma glucose have been identified on 2q24-q32 (FGQTL1), related to single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vicinity of the G6PC2 gene (608058); on 7p15-p13 (FGQTL2; 613219), related to SNPs in the vicinity of the glucokinase gene (GCK; 138079); on 11q21-q22 (FGQTL3; 613233), related to SNPs in the vicinity of the MTNR1B gene (600804); on 7p21.2 (FGQTL4; 613462), in the vicinity of the DGKB gene (604070); on 2p23.3-p23.2 (FGQTL5; 613463) due to variation in the GCKR gene (600842); and on 3q21 (FGQTL6; 613460), in the vicinity of the ADCY5 gene (600293). <br> See 613219 for a discussion of birth weight as a quantitative trait, another glycemic-influenced trait with an effect on T2D risk.

612119=><br> Trehalose is a disaccharide found in mushrooms, algae, and insect hemolymph; mushrooms and products containing baker's yeast are thus the only sources of trehalose in the human diet. The high concentration of trehalose in cryptobiotic plants is responsible for their remarkable ability to go through cycles of desiccation and rehydration without injury. This led to interest by the food industry in the addition of trehalose to foodstuffs to improve the longevity and quality of dried food. However, ingestion of a disaccharide in an individual who cannot digest it results in osmotic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and increased rectal flatulence (summary by Murray et al., 2000). Isolated trehalose intolerance due to deficiency of trehalase (TREH; 275360) is probably rare in adult white Americans (Welsh et al., 1978), but has been estimated at 8% in Greenlanders (Gudmand-Hoyer et al., 1988). <br>

612126=><br> GLUT1 deficiency syndrome-2 is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized primarily by onset in childhood of paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia. The dyskinesia involves transient abnormal involuntary movements, such as dystonia and choreoathetosis, induced by exercise or exertion, and affecting the exercised limbs. Some patients may also have epilepsy, most commonly childhood absence epilepsy, with an average onset of about 2 to 3 years. Mild mental retardation may also occur. One family has been reported with the additional feature of hemolytic anemia (Weber et al., 2008). GLUT1 deficiency syndrome-2 shows wide clinical variability both within and between affected families. The disorder, which results from a defect in the GLUT1 glucose transporter causing decreased glucose concentration in the central nervous system, is part of a spectrum of neurologic phenotypes resulting from GLUT1 deficiency. GLUT1 deficiency syndrome-1 (606777) represents the more severe end of the phenotypic spectrum. Correct diagnosis of GLUT1 deficiency is important because a ketogenic diet often results in marked clinical improvement in motor and seizure symptoms (reviews by Pascual et al., 2004 and Brockmann, 2009). <br>

The tumors include Ewing sarcoma, peripheral neuroepithelioma, and Askin tumor. In approximately 90% of cases of ESFT, the FLI1 gene (193067) on chromosome 11 is the fusion partner of EWS; in approximately 10%, the EWS fusion partner is the ERG gene (165080) on chromosome 22.

Ketosis-prone diabetes, the most common atypical form, is characterized by an acute initial presentation with severe hyperglycemia and ketosis, as seen in classic type 1 diabetes, but after initiation of insulin therapy, prolonged remission is often possible with cessation of insulin therapy and maintenance of appropriate metabolic control. Metabolic studies show a markedly blunted insulin secretory response to glucose, partially reversible with the improvement of blood glucose control. Variable levels of insulin resistance are observed, especially in obese patients.

This core oligosaccharide is sequentially processed by several ER glycosidases and by an endomannosidase (E.C. 3.2.1.130), such as MANEA, in the Golgi.

612336=><br> Heterozygous protein S deficiency, like protein C deficiency (176860), is characterized by recurrent venous thrombosis. Bertina (1990) classified protein S deficiency into 3 clinical subtypes based on laboratory findings. Type I refers to deficiency of both free and total protein S as well as decreased protein S activity; type II shows normal plasma values, but decreased protein S activity; and type III shows decreased free protein S levels and activity, but normal total protein S levels. Approximately 40% of protein S circulates as a free active form, whereas the remaining 60% circulates as an inactive form bound to C4BPA (120830). <br> Zoller et al. (1995) observed coexistence of type I and type III PROS1-deficient phenotypes within a single family and determined that the subtypes are allelic. Under normal conditions, the concentration of protein S exceeds that of C4BPA by approximately 30 to 40%. Thus, free protein S is the molar surplus of protein S over C4BPA. Mild protein S deficiency will thus present with selective deficiency of free protein S, whereas more pronounced protein S deficiency will also decrease the complexed protein S and consequently the total protein S level. These findings explained why assays for free protein S have a higher predictive value for protein S deficiency. <br>

612358=><br> High molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) plays an important role in assembly of the plasma kallikrein (see 147910)-kinin system. The KNG1 gene generates both HMWK and low molecular weight kininogen (LMWK) through alternative splicing. Both HMWK and LMWK contain an identical heavy chain consisting of protein domains 1, 2, and 3. However, HMWK contains a 56-kD light chain that consists of domains 5 and 6H, whereas LMWK contains a unique 4-kD light chain that consists of domain 5L. In both proteins, the heavy and light chains are linked by domain 4, which contains the bradykinin (BK) nonapeptide. BK, which is released by plasma kallikrein, is a potent inflammatory mediator that causes vasodilation and enhanced capillary permeability, induces pain, and stimulates production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin (see 601699) from endothelial cells. During vascular damage, BK stimulates smooth muscle proliferation and intimal hypertrophy. Release of BK from HMWK generates a 2-chain HMWK, termed HMWKa, containing the heavy and light chains joined by a disulfide bond (Merkulov et al., 2008). <br>

612444=><br> Primary ciliary dyskinesia is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from loss of normal ciliary function. Kartagener (pronounced KART-agayner) syndrome is characterized by the combination of primary ciliary dyskinesia and situs inversus, and occurs in approximately half of patients with ciliary dyskinesia. Since normal nodal ciliary movement in the embryo is required for normal visceral asymmetry, absence of normal ciliary movement results in a lack of definitive patterning; thus, random chance alone appears to determine whether the viscera take up the normal or reversed left-right position during embryogenesis. This explains why approximately 50% of patients, even within the same family, have situs inversus (Afzelius, 1976; El Zein et al., 2003). <br>

BH4 is a required cofactor for the synthesis of these neurotransmitters. BH4 is also a required cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH; 612349), but patients with SPR deficiency do not exhibit overt hyperphenylalaninemia. The lack of hyperphenylalaninemia distinguishes SPR deficiency from other disorders of BH4 synthesis (see, e.g., HPABH4A, 261640). However, the neurologic phenotype of SPR deficiency resembles the other BH4-deficient disorders (Bonafe et al., 2001). <br>

612724=><br> Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13) is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The enzyme is a tetramer of identical 40-kD subunits. Vertebrates have 3 aldolase isozymes, aldolase A (103850), B (ALDOB), and C (ALDOC; 103870), which are distinguished by their electrophoretic and catalytic properties. The sequence of the aldolases around the active-site lysine is highly conserved in evolution. Mammalian tissues express aldolase isozymes in a well-characterized pattern. Developing embryo produces aldolase A, which continues to be expressed in many adult tissues, sometimes at much higher levels than in embryo. In adult muscle, aldolase A can be as much as 5% of total cellular protein. In adult liver, kidney, and intestine, aldolase A expression is repressed and aldolase B is produced. In brain and other nervous tissue, aldolase A and C are expressed about equally. In transformed liver cells, aldolase A replaces aldolase B (Rottmann et al., 1984). <br>

612735=><br> Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules present antigens to CD4 (186940)-positive cells. Human class II MHC molecules are of 3 major isotypes, HLA-DR, HLA-DP (see 142880), and HLA-DQ (see 146880), each of which consists of an alpha and a beta chain. Both the alpha and beta chains of HLA-DP and HLA-DQ are polymorphic, whereas HLA-DR alpha (HLA-DRA; 142860) is invariant and HLA-DR beta (HLA-DRB) is polymorphic. Thus, differences in the HLA-DR beta chain account for different peptide-binding motifs of HLA-DR molecules. The most highly expressed HLA-DR beta chain is encoded by the extremely polymorphic HLA-DRB1 gene (142857). Most of the alternate beta chain genes linked to HLA-DRB1 are pseudogenes (HLA-DRB2 and HLA-DRB6 through -DRB9), but HLA-DRB3, HLA-DRB4, and HLA-DRB5 (604776) encode functional proteins. HLA-DRB3 is also known as HLA-DR52 and has 3 major alleles: DRB3*0101 (DR52a), DRB3*0202 (DR52b), and DRB3*0301 (DR52c) (Dai et al., 2008). <br>

613118=><br> Deficiency of antithrombin III is a major risk factor for venous thromboembolic disease. Two categories of AT-III deficiency have been defined on the basis of AT-III antigen levels in the plasma of affected individuals. The majority of AT-III deficiency families belong in the type I (classic) deficiency group and have a quantitatively abnormal phenotype in which antigen and heparin cofactor levels are both reduced to about 50% of normal. The second category of AT-III deficiency has been termed type II (functional) deficiency. Affected individuals from these kindreds produce dysfunctional AT-III molecules; they have reduced heparin cofactor activity levels (about 50% of normal) but levels of AT-III antigen are often normal or nearly normal (summary by Bock and Prochownik, 1987). <br> The 2 categories of antithrombmin III deficiency have been classified further. Type I (low functional and immunologic antithrombin) has been subdivided into subtype Ia (reduced levels of normal antithrombin), and type Ib (reduced levels of antithrombin and the presence of low levels of a variant). Type II (low functional but normal immunologic antithrombin) has been subdivided into subtype IIa (functional abnormalities affecting both the reactive site and the heparin-binding site of AT3); subtype IIb (functional abnormalities limited to the reactive site); and subtype IIc (functional abnormalities limited to the heparin-binding site) (summary by Lane et al., 1992). <br>

On mRNAs without PTCs, the CBP80/CBP20 complex is replaced with cytoplasmic mRNA cap-binding proteins, including EIF4G (600495), and steady-state translation of the mRNAs resumes in the cytoplasm (Kim et al., 2009). <br>

The extremes of birth weight are associated with high risks of perinatal morbidity and mortality. In addition, there are well-documented observational associations between lower birth weight and later-life chronic disease, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and higher blood pressure (e.g., Barker et al., 1993). Birth weight may be influenced directly by fetal genotype and indirectly by maternal genotype operating through the intrauterine environment. The importance of genetic factors acting independently of the intrauterine environment is illustrated by correlations between paternal height or weight and offspring birth weight, and genetic variants that are associated both with low birth weight and increased risk of type 2 diabetes may account for some of the observed correlation between these phenotypes (Hattersley and Tooke, 1999). <br> The BWQTL1 locus represents association of birth weight as a quantitative trait with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 7p15-p13 in the vicinity of the glucokinase gene (GCK; 138079).

They play important roles in the regulation of target genes by binding to complementary regions of messenger transcripts to repress their translation or regulate degradation (summarized by Griffiths-Jones et al., 2006). <br> Two genes encoding miR33 isoforms exist in humans: miR33B, which is present in intron 17 of the SREBP1 (184756) gene on chromosome 17, and miR33A (612156), which is located in intron 16 of the SREBP2 (600481) gene on chromosome 22.

613491=><br> Ceramides are synthesized during epidermal differentiation and accumulate within the interstices of the stratum corneum, where they represent critical components of the epidermal permeability barrier. Excess cellular ceramide can trigger antimitogenic signals and induce apoptosis, and the ceramide metabolites sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are important bioregulatory molecules. Ceramide hydrolysis in the nucleated cell layers regulates keratinocyte proliferation and apoptosis in response to external stress. Ceramide hydrolysis also occurs at the stratum corneum, releasing free sphingoid base that functions as an endogenous antimicrobial agent. ACER1 is highly expressed in epidermis and catalyzes the hydrolysis of very long chain ceramides to generate sphingosine (Houben et al., 2006; Sun et al., 2008). <br>

613546=><br> Aromatase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder in which individuals cannot synthesize endogenous estrogens. If a fetus lacks aromatase activity, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate produced by the fetal adrenal glands cannot be converted to estrogen by the placenta, and is converted to testosterone peripherally and results in virilization of both fetus and mother. Virilization manifests as pseudohermaphroditism in female infants, with hirsutism and acne in the mother; the maternal indicators resolve following delivery. Affected females are usually diagnosed at birth because of the pseudohermaphroditism. Cystic ovaries and delayed bone maturation can occur during childhood and adolescence in these girls, who present at puberty with primary amenorrhea, failure of breast development, virilization, and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Affected males do not present with obvious defects at birth. Their clinical symptoms include tall stature, delayed skeletal maturation, delayed epiphyseal closure, bone pain, eunuchoid body proportions, and excess adiposity. Estrogen replacement therapy reverses the symptoms in males and females (summary by Jones et al., 2007). <br>

Formation of amyloid-beta is catalyzed by gamma-secretase (see PSEN1; 104311), a protease with numerous substrates. PION, or GSAP, selectively increases amyloid-beta production through a mechanism involving its interaction with both gamma-secretase and its substrate, the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP; 104760) C-terminal fragment (APP-CTF) (He et al., 2010). <br>

613554=><br> Von Willebrand disease is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. It is characterized clinically by mucocutaneous bleeding, such as epistaxis and menorrhagia, and prolonged bleeding after surgery or trauma. It results from a defect in platelet aggregation due to defects in the von Willebrand factor. Von Willebrand factor is a large, multimeric protein that plays a role in platelet adhesion and also serves as a carrier for the thrombotic protein factor VIII (F8; 300841). F8 is mutated in hemophilia A (306700) (review by Goodeve, 2010). <br> Whereas von Willebrand disease types 1 (193400) and 3 (277480) are characterized by quantitative defects in the VWF gene, Von Willebrand disease type 2, which is divided in subtypes 2A, 2B, 2M, and 2N, is characterized by qualitative abnormalities of the VWF protein. The mutant VWF protein in types 2A, 2B, and 2M are defective in their platelet-dependent function, whereas the mutant protein in type 2N is defective in its ability to bind F8. VWD2 accounts for 20 to 30% of cases of VWD (Mannucci, 2004; Sadler et al., 2006; Lillicrap, 2009; Goodeve, 2010). <br> For a general discussion and a classification of the types of von Willebrand disease, see VWD type 1 (193400). <br>

In contrast with other FCRL proteins, which are found on B lymphocytes, FCRL6 is expressed on cytotoxic T and natural killer (NK) cells and on expanded populations of terminally differentiated CD8 (see 186910)-positive cells in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; see 609423) infection and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; see 151400) (summary by Schreeder et al., 2010). <br>

The most striking phenotypic feature is that affected girls are born with ambiguous genitalia, indicating intrauterine androgen excess. After birth, however, virilization does not progress and amounts of circulating androgens are low or normal. Affected boys are sometimes born undermasculinized.

It is expressed on erythrocytes, endothelial cells of capillary and postcapillary venules, epithelial cells of kidney collecting ducts and lung alveoli, and Purkinje cells of cerebellum. DARC is a promiscuous chemokine receptor that binds chemokines of both CXC (e.g., IL8; 146930) and CC (e.g., CCL5; 187011) classes, suggesting that it plays a role in inflammatory reactions. In addition, DARC serves as the erythroid receptor for the human malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax and the monkey malarial parasite Plasmodium knowlesi, which occasionally infects humans (see 611162). Variation in DARC forms the basis of the Duffy blood group system (110700) (reviews by Pogo and Chaudhuri (2000), Langhi and Bordin (2006), and Meny (2010)). <br>

The 'NF1 microdeletion syndrome' is often characterized by a more severe phenotype than that observed in the majority of NF1 patients. In particular, patients with NF1 microdeletion often show variable facial dysmorphism, mental retardation, developmental delay, an excessive number of early-onset neurofibromas (Venturin et al., 2004), and an increased risk for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (De Raedt et al., 2003). <br>

The Maroteaux type of brachyolmia is an autosomal recessive form in which there is rounding of the anterior and posterior vertebral borders, with less elongation on lateral view and less lateral extension on anteroposterior view than is seen in the Hobaek type of brachyolmia (271530). Maroteaux brachyolmia may also be associated with precocious calcification of the falx cerebri, and minor facial anomalies (summary by Shohat et al., 1989). <br> For a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of brachyolmia, see 271530. <br>
613679=><br> Prothrombin deficiency is an extremely rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder characterized by low levels of circulating prothrombin; it affects about 1 in 2,000,000 individuals. There are 2 main types: type I deficiency, known as true prothrombin deficiency or 'hypoprothrombinemia,' is defined as plasma levels of prothrombin being less than 10% of normal with a concomitant decrease in activity. These patients have severe bleeding from birth, including umbilical cord hemorrhage, hematomas, ecchymoses, hematuria, mucosal bleeding, hemarthroses, intracranial bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, and menorrhagia. Type II deficiency, known as 'dysprothrombinemia,' is characterized by normal or low-normal synthesis of a dysfunctional protein. Bleeding symptoms are more variable, depending on the amount of residual functional activity. Variant prothrombin gene alleles can result in 'hypoprothrombinemia' or 'dysprothrombinemia,' and individuals who are compound heterozygous for these 2 types of alleles have variable manifestations. Heterozygous mutation carriers, who have plasma levels between 40 and 60% of normal, are usually asymptomatic, but can show bleeding after tooth extraction or surgical procedures (review by Lancellotti and De Cristofaro, 2009). <br>

613684=><br> Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by mental retardation, postnatal growth deficiency, microcephaly, broad thumbs and halluces, and dysmorphic facial features. The classic facial appearance is striking, with highly arched eyebrows, long eyelashes, downslanting palpebral fissures, broad nasal bridge, beaked nose with the nasal septum, highly arched palate, mild micrognathia, and characteristic grimacing or abnormal smile (Rubinstein and Taybi, 1963; review by Hennekam, 2006). <br> About 50 to 70% of patients have RSTS1 due to mutation in the CREBBP gene (600140). RSTS2 is much less common, and about 3% of patients have mutations in the EP300 gene. RSTS2 appears to be associated with a milder phenotype than RSTS1. Patients with RSTS2 have less severe facial dysmorphism and better cognitive function, but may have more severe microcephaly and malformation of facial bone structures compared to those with RSTS1 (Bartsch et al., 2010). <br>

613778=><br> Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is a common complex disorder that affects the central region of the retina (macula) and is the leading cause of legal blindness in white Americans over age 65. Contributions of environmental factors and genetic susceptibility have been identified. The strongest nongenetic risk factor for ARMD is cigarette smoking.

613779=><br> The main clinical manifestation of primary C3 deficiency is childhood-onset of recurrent bacterial infections, mainly caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as Neisseria meningitidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli; infections with gram-positive bacteria also occur. Infections in the upper and lower respiratory tract, including pneumonia, episodes of sinusitis, tonsillitis, and otitis, are the most frequent consequence of the C3 deficiency. Approximately 26% of patients with C3 deficiency develop immune complex-mediated autoimmune diseases resembling systemic lupus erythematosus (see 152700), and about 26% of patients develop mesangiocapillary or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, resulting in renal failure (summary by Reis et al., 2006). <br>

613785=><br> The complement system is a major mediator of innate immunity. The first enzymatic event in the cascade of the classical pathway of complement is the activation of its first component, C1. C1 is a multimolecular complex consisting of 2 loosely interacting entities: C1q (see 120550), the recognition subunit, and C1r(2)/C1s(2), the catalytic one. C1r(2)/C1s(2) is a tetrameric Ca(2+)-dependent complex of C1r and C1s (120580), 2 serine-proteinase zymogens. C1r acts by transforming the activation signal (the fixation of C1q on activating reagents, e.g., immune complexes) into an enzymic activity (summary by Journet and Tosi, 1986). <br>

Postaxial polydactyly, renal anomalies, cleft palate, congenital heart defects (especially atrioventricular septal defects), preauricular pits, sacral dimple, and gastrointestinal anomalies are variable features. Although intellectual deficits are almost invariably associated with cytogenetically visible 3p deletions, rare patients with a 3p26-p25 deletion and normal intelligence or only mild abnormalities have been described (summary by Shuib et al., 2009). <br>
613793=><br> The Cromer blood group system (CROM) consists of 12 high-prevalence and 3 low-prevalence antigens that reside on decay-accelerating factor (DAF, or CD55; 125240), a regulator of complement activation. Nearly all Cromer antigens result from SNPs in the DAF gene. The red blood cells (RBCs) of people with the Cromer-null phenotype, Inab, lack DAF but do not appear to show increased susceptibility to hemolysis. Antibodies to Cromer antigens are rarely encountered, although evidence suggests that the antibodies may cause accelerated destruction of transfused RBCs. Cromer system antibodies are not associated with hemolytic disease of the newborn, because placenta is a rich source of fetally derived DAF, which is thought to absorb the antibodies (review by Storry et al., 2010). <br>

613843=><br> Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), early-onset retinal degeneration (EORD), and retinitis pigmentosa (RP) may be considered a continuum of entities, in which LCA represents the extreme end of severity, in terms of age of onset and functional outcome. Based on behavior toward light during the first 2 years of life, Hanein et al. (2004) divided patients with LCA/EORD into 2 main groups: congenital or very early cone-rod dystrophy, in which patients exhibit photophobia, and severe yet progressive rod-cone dystrophy, in which patients exhibit night blindness with or without hypermetropia. Poor vision may either be present at birth or develop progressively during childhood or adolescence. Fundus examination is usually normal at birth and retinopathy does not become evident for several years. Extinguished electroretinograms (ERGs) before the age of 1 year can be used as a criterion to distinguish LCA from EORD. Associated clinical signs such as posterior polar cataract and keratoconus may be part of the phenotype, and refractive error also seems to be a distinct feature, as patients with mutation in certain genes are very hyperopic, whereas other mutated genes are associated with emmetropia or high myopia (summary by Mataftsi et al., 2007). <br>

613913=><br> Acquired partial lipodystrophy (APLD) is characterized clinically by the gradual onset of bilaterally symmetrical loss of subcutaneous fat from the face, neck, upper extremities, thorax, and abdomen, in the 'cephalocaudal' sequence, sparing the lower extremities. A large group of patients (83%) with acquired partial lipodystrophy have low serum levels of complement component C3 due to the presence of C3 nephritic factor, an IgG antibody that causes continuous activation of the alternative complement pathway and consumption of serum C3. About 22% of patients with this acquired complement defect develop membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Some individuals may also show an increased risk of infection (Misra et al., 2004). <br> Acquired partial lipodystrophy is not inherited in a classic mendelian pattern; it rather represents a phenotype with a complex etiology. Affected individuals may have genetic susceptibility factors that require the additional presence of environmental factors or acquired disorders to be expressed (summary by Hegele et al., 2006). Most cases are sporadic, family history is negative, and females are more often affected than males (ratio, 4:1) (summary by Misra et al., 2004). <br> See 608709 for a subtype of APLD not associated with low complement C3 or renal disease. <br>

613977=><br> Neonatal cyanosis is characterized by symptoms in the fetus and neonate that gradually abate by 5 to 6 months of age. The disorder is caused by a defect in the fetal hemoglobin chain, which causes reduced affinity for oxygen due to steric inhibition of oxygen binding and/or due to increased oxidation of the fetal hemoglobin molecule to methemoglobin (Hb FM), which has decreased oxygen-binding capacity. Some patients develop anemia resulting from increased destruction of red cells containing abnormal or unstable hemoglobin.

Reduced amounts of detectable beta globin causes beta-plus-thalassemia. For clinical purposes, beta-thalassemia is divided into thalassemia major (transfusion dependent), thalassemia intermedia (of intermediate severity), and thalassemia minor (asymptomatic, carrier state). The molecular and clinical aspects of the beta-thalassemias were reviewed by Olivieri (1999). <br> The remarkable phenotypic diversity of the beta-thalassemias reflects the heterogeneity of mutations at the HBB locus, the action of many secondary and tertiary modifiers, and a wide range of environmental factors (Weatherall, 2001). <br>
